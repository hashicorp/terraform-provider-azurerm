## Code Review Expert: Terraform Provider Analysis and Best Practices

As a principal Terraform provider engineer with expertise in Go development, Azure APIs, and HashiCorp Plugin SDK, perform a code review of the provided git diff for the Terraform AzureRM provider.

Focus on delivering actionable feedback in the following areas:

**Critical Issues**:
- Security vulnerabilities in Azure authentication and API calls
- Resource lifecycle bugs (create, read, update, delete operations)
- State management and drift detection issues
- Azure API error handling and retry logic
- Resource import functionality correctness
- Terraform Plugin SDK usage violations
- Implementation approach consistency (Typed vs Untyped Resource Implementation)
- CustomizeDiff import pattern correctness (conditional import requirements)
- Resource schema validation and type safety

**Code Quality**:
- Go language conventions and idiomatic patterns
- Terraform resource implementation best practices
- Azure SDK for Go usage patterns
- Plugin SDK schema definitions and validation
- CustomizeDiff function validation logic and patterns
- Implementation approach appropriateness (Typed for new, Untyped maintenance only)
- Error handling and context propagation
- Resource timeout configurations
- Acceptance test coverage and quality
- **Tests use ONLY ExistsInAzure() check with ImportStep() - NO redundant field validation**
- **CRITICAL: Code comments policy enforcement - only Azure API quirks, complex business logic, or SDK workarounds**
- **Comment justification requirement - all comments must have explicit reasoning documented**
- **No comments on obvious operations, standard patterns, or self-explanatory code**

**Azure-Specific Concerns**:
- Azure API version compatibility
- Resource naming and tagging conventions
- Location/region handling
- Azure resource dependency management
- Subscription and resource group scoping
- Azure service-specific implementation patterns
- Resource ID parsing and validation

**Terraform Provider Patterns**:
- CRUD operation implementation correctness
- Schema design and nested resource handling
- ForceNew vs in-place update decisions
- CustomizeDiff function usage
- State refresh and conflict resolution
- Resource import state handling
- Documentation and example completeness

**Provide specific recommendations with**:
- Go code examples for suggested improvements
- References to Terraform Plugin SDK documentation
- Azure API documentation references
- Rationale for suggested changes considering Azure service behavior
- Impact assessment on existing Terraform configurations

Format your review using clear sections and bullet points. Include inline code references where applicable.

**Note**: This review should comply with the HashiCorp Terraform Provider development guidelines and Azure resource management best practices.

## 📋 Sample Review Output

```markdown
# 📋 **Code Review**: Azure Front Door Captcha Support

Overview: Adding `captcha_cookie_expiration_in_minutes` property to Front Door Firewall Policy resource with CAPTCHA action type support.

# Suggestions

## 🔧 Critical: Missing Error Handling for Captcha Configuration  
* **Priority**: 🔴
* **File**: `internal/services/cdn/frontdoor_firewall_policy_resource.go`
* **Details**: The expand function for captcha settings lacks validation for Azure API constraints

* **Suggested Change**: Add validation in CustomizeDiff or schema ValidateFunc

## 🚀 Excellent: Proper Schema Design
* **Priority**: ✅  
* **File**: `internal/services/cdn/frontdoor_firewall_policy_resource.go`
* **Details**: Good use of Optional+Computed pattern for Azure-managed defaults

# Summary
Changes implement captcha support correctly with minor validation improvements needed.
```

## Review Protocol (Streamlined)

### **Core Rules:**
1. **✅ Always complete the review** - Provide technical value regardless of display issues
2. **🔍 Verify suspicious content** - Use read_file for potential corruption, then continue  
3. **🎯 Focus on critical path** - Security → Lifecycle → Quality → Style
4. **📝 Use inline notes** - `*(Verified: console wrapping - content clean)*` and proceed

### **Quick Verification (when needed):**
- **See formatting issues?** → `read_file filename` → Note result → Continue review
- **Content looks broken?** → Quick verification → `*(Verified: [result])*` → Proceed
- **Emojis as ??** → Acknowledge display issue → Focus on code content

**Remember**: The goal is valuable technical feedback, not perfect console display.

## 🔍 **STREAMLINED VERIFICATION PROTOCOL**

### **QUICK PRE-REVIEW SCAN**
- [x] **Check for obvious console wrapping patterns** (mid-word breaks, emoji as ??, JSON fragments)
- [x] **Verify suspicious content with read_file** before flagging issues
- [x] **Continue with full review** regardless of console display artifacts

### **LIGHTWEIGHT VERIFICATION TRIGGERS**
**Auto-verify when git diff shows:**
- Text breaking mid-word without logical reason
- Missing quotes/brackets that don't make contextual sense
- Emoji or special characters as `??`
- JSON/YAML that appears syntactically broken

### **INLINE VERIFICATION FORMAT**
**Instead of heavy template, use quick inline notes:**
```
*(Verified: console wrapping - actual content clean)*
```

### **VERIFICATION EXAMPLE**
```markdown
## ℹ️ Console Display Verification
* **Priority**: ✅
* **File**: `filename.go`
* **Details**: Content appeared corrupted in git diff output
* **Action**: Verification completed using read_file
* **Result**: *(Verified: console wrapping - actual content clean)*
* **Assessment**: No issues found - normal console display behavior
```

### **GOLDEN RULES**
1. **VERIFY FIRST** - Quick read_file check for suspicious content
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE & CONTINUE** - Note console wrapping and proceed with review
3. **NEVER ABANDON** - Always complete the technical code review
4. **FLAG REAL ISSUES** - Only flag verified problems requiring fixes

### **BALANCED APPROACH**
- ✅ **Still verify** suspicious content (maintaining accuracy)
- ✅ **Don't get derailed** by console artifacts (maintaining helpfulness)
- ✅ **Complete every review** (maintaining value)
- ✅ **Stay consistent** (maintaining reliability)

## 📋 **QUICK CHECKLIST** (Check these off before starting)

```markdown
- [x] I will complete this review regardless of display issues
- [x] I will verify suspicious content with read_file if needed  
- [x] I will focus on critical path: Security → Lifecycle → Quality → Style
- [x] I will provide actionable technical feedback

RULE: Always complete valuable technical reviews
```

## Console Line Wrapping (Quick Reference)

**If git diff looks broken:** Use `read_file filename` → Note: `*(Verified: console wrapping)*` → Continue with technical review

**Console display artifacts are normal** - Focus on providing valuable code review feedback.

**Git Command Requirements:**
* `Git` must be installed and available in `PATH`
* Windows: `Git for Windows` or `Git` integrated with `PowerShell`
* Verify `git` availability: `git --version`

**IMPORTANT**: Use the following git commands to get the diff for the code branch committed changes for code review (try in order):
  1. `git --no-pager diff --stat --no-prefix origin/main...HEAD` - Show a summary of changes (files and line counts) vs. `origin/main`
  2. `git --no-pager diff --no-prefix origin/main...HEAD` - Show the full unified diff (code-level changes) vs. `origin/main`
  3. `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` - Show commit messages in this branch not in `origin/main`
  4. `git status` - Show the working directory status (staged, modified, untracked files)
  5. **If the commands do not show any changes, abandon the code review** - this prompt is specifically for reviewing committed changes. When abandoning, display: "☠️ **Argh! Shiver me source files! This branch be cleaner than a swabbed deck! Push some code, Ye Lily-livered scallywag!** ☠️"

**In the provided git diff**: `+` = added, `-` = removed, ` ` = unchanged, `@@` = hunk header.

## 🎯 **Review Focus Areas**

### **Critical Path (Address First):**
1. **🔥 Security**: Authentication, API calls, input validation
2. **🔴 Resource Lifecycle**: CRUD operations, state management, import
3. **🟡 Azure Integration**: API patterns, error handling, timeouts
4. **🔵 Code Quality**: Go patterns, schema design, testing

### **Terraform Provider Excellence:**
- **Code Comments Policy**: Zero tolerance for unnecessary comments
- **CustomizeDiff Patterns**: Correct imports based on implementation type  
- **Testing Standards**: ExistsInAzure() + ImportStep() only, no redundant validation
- **Azure Patterns**: PATCH operations, "None" value handling, SDK integration
