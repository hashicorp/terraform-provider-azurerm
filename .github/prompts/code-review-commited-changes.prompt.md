## Code Review Expert: Terraform Provider Analysis and Best Practices

As a senior Terraform provider engineer with expertise in Go development, Azure APIs, and HashiCorp Plugin SDK, perform a code review of the provided git diff for the Terraform AzureRM provider.

Focus on delivering actionable feedback in the following areas:

Critical Issues:
- Security vulnerabilities in Azure authentication and API calls
- Resource lifecycle bugs (create, read, update, delete operations)
- State management and drift detection issues
- Azure API error handling and retry logic
- Resource import functionality correctness
- Terraform Plugin SDK usage violations
- Implementation approach consistency (Typed vs Untyped Resource Implementation)
- CustomizeDiff import pattern correctness (dual import requirement)
- Resource schema validation and type safety

Code Quality:
- Go language conventions and idiomatic patterns
- Terraform resource implementation best practices
- Azure SDK for Go usage patterns
- Plugin SDK schema definitions and validation
- CustomizeDiff function implementation patterns and import requirements
- Implementation approach appropriateness (Typed for new, Untyped maintenance only)
- Error handling and context propagation
- Resource timeout configurations
- Acceptance test coverage and quality

Azure-Specific Concerns:
- Azure API version compatibility
- Resource naming and tagging conventions
- Location/region handling
- Azure resource dependency management
- Subscription and resource group scoping
- Azure service-specific implementation patterns
- Resource ID parsing and validation

Terraform Provider Patterns:
- CRUD operation implementation correctness
- Schema design and nested resource handling
- ForceNew vs in-place update decisions
- CustomizeDiff function usage
- State refresh and conflict resolution
- Resource import state handling
- Documentation and example completeness

Provide specific recommendations with:
- Go code examples for suggested improvements
- References to Terraform Plugin SDK documentation
- Azure API documentation references
- Rationale for suggested changes considering Azure service behavior
- Impact assessment on existing Terraform configurations

Format your review using clear sections and bullet points. Include inline code references where applicable.

Note: This review should comply with the HashiCorp Terraform Provider development guidelines and Azure resource management best practices.

## Constraints

* **IMPORTANT**: Use `git --no-pager diff --no-prefix --unified=3 main...HEAD` to get the diff for code review.
* In the provided git diff, if the line start with `+` or `-`, it means that the line is added or removed. If the line starts with a space, it means that the line is unchanged. If the line starts with `@@`, it means that the line is a hunk header.

* Avoid overwhelming the developer with too many suggestions at once.
* Use clear and concise language to ensure understanding.

* Focus on Terraform provider-specific concerns and Go best practices.
* Pay special attention to Azure API integration patterns and error handling.
* Consider the impact on existing Terraform configurations and state management.
* If there are any TODO comments, make sure to address them in the review.

* Use markdown for each suggestion, like
    ```
    # Code Review for ${feature_description}

    Overview of the code changes, including the purpose of the Azure resource implementation, any relevant context about the Azure service, and the files involved.

### Use Code Review Emojis

Use code review emojis. Give the reviewee added context and clarity to follow up on code review. For example, knowing whether something really requires action (üîß), highlighting nit-picky comments (‚õè), flagging out of scope items for follow-up (üìå) and clarifying items that don‚Äôt necessarily require action but are worth saying ( üëç, üìù, ü§î )

#### Emoji Legend

|       |      `:code:`       | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|   üìù   |      `:memo:`       | This is an explanatory note, fun fact, or relevant commentary that does not require any action.                                                                                                                                    |
|   üå±   |    `:seedling:`     | An observation or suggestion that is not a change request, but may have larger implications. Generally something to keep in mind for the future.

### Terraform Provider Specific Review Points

When reviewing Terraform AzureRM provider code, pay special attention to:

#### CustomizeDiff Import Requirements
- **Dual Import Pattern**: When reviewing CustomizeDiff functions, verify both packages are imported:
  - github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2/helper/schema for *schema.ResourceDiff
  - github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/tf/pluginsdk for resource types
- **Correct Function Signatures**: Ensure CustomizeDiff functions use *schema.ResourceDiff (not aliased in pluginsdk)
- **Helper Function Usage**: Verify proper use of pluginsdk.All(), pluginsdk.ForceNewIfChange() helpers

#### Resource Implementation
- **CRUD Operations**: Ensure Create, Read, Update, Delete functions handle all edge cases
- **Schema Validation**: Verify all required fields, validation functions, and type definitions
- **ForceNew Logic**: Check that properties requiring resource recreation are properly marked
- **Timeouts**: Ensure appropriate timeout values for Azure operations (often long-running)

#### Azure API Integration
- **Error Handling**: Verify proper handling of Azure API errors, including 404s during Read operations
- **Polling**: Check for proper implementation of long-running operation polling
- **API Versions**: Ensure correct and consistent Azure API versions are used
- **Authentication**: Verify proper use of Azure client authentication patterns

#### State Management
- **Drift Detection**: Ensure Read operations properly detect and handle resource drift
- **Import Functionality**: Verify resource import works correctly and sets all required attributes
- **Nested Resources**: Check proper handling of complex nested Azure resource structures
- **Resource IDs**: Ensure consistent Azure resource ID parsing and formatting

#### Testing
- **Acceptance Tests**: Verify comprehensive test coverage including error scenarios
- **Test Cleanup**: Ensure tests properly clean up Azure resources
- **Multiple Regions**: Check if tests account for regional Azure service availability
- **Test Configuration**: Verify test fixtures use appropriate Azure resource configurations

#### Documentation
- **Examples**: Ensure realistic and working Terraform configuration examples
- **Attributes**: Verify all resource attributes are documented with correct types
- **Import Documentation**: Check that import syntax and requirements are clearly documented
