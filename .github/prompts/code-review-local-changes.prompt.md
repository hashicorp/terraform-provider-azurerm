**Before executing any review commands:**

**IF changes include the file `.github/prompts/code-review-local-changes.prompt.md`:**
- **SKIP** reviewing this specific file in the detailed review
- **LOG** in the review output: "- **File Skipped**: `.github/prompts/code-review-local-changes.prompt.md` - Cannot review code review prompt itself to prevent infinite loops"
- **CONTINUE** reviewing all other changed files normally

**This prevents self-review loops while allowing the review process to complete.**

# üöÄ **EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY** - Code Review Task

**PRIMARY TASK**: Perform code review of local changes for Terraform AzureRM provider

## ‚ö° **START HERE - MANDATORY EXECUTION STEPS**

**1. GET THE DIFF - Run git commands to find changes:**

**Use the `run_in_terminal` tool with these exact patterns:**

```
# STEP 1: Check git status for overall state (including untracked files)
run_in_terminal:
  command: "git status --porcelain"
  explanation: "Check git status for overall state including untracked files"
  isBackground: false

# STEP 2: Get file summary for tracked files (to count changed files)
run_in_terminal:
  command: "git --no-pager diff --stat --no-prefix"
  explanation: "Get file summary for tracked files to count changed files"
  isBackground: false

# STEP 3: Get detailed changes for tracked files
run_in_terminal:
  command: "git --no-pager diff --no-prefix --unified=3"
  explanation: "Get detailed changes for tracked files"
  isBackground: false

# STEP 4: Check staged changes ONLY if no unstaged changes found in STEP 3
run_in_terminal:
  command: "git --no-pager diff --stat --no-prefix --staged"
  explanation: "Check staged file summary ONLY if no unstaged changes found"
  isBackground: false

run_in_terminal:
  command: "git --no-pager diff --no-prefix --unified=3 --staged"
  explanation: "Get detailed staged changes ONLY if no unstaged changes found"
  isBackground: false

# STEP 5: Get current branch name
run_in_terminal:
  command: "git branch --show-current"
  explanation: "Get current branch name"
  isBackground: false

# STEP 6: Handle untracked files (new files not in git yet)
# If git status shows untracked files, examine them individually using read_file tool
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**:
- If git status shows NO changes (tracked, staged, or untracked), abandon review and display: **"‚ò†Ô∏è **Argh! There be no changes here!** ‚ò†Ô∏è"**
- If ONLY untracked files exist, review them as new file additions
- Untracked files are often the most critical changes to review (new features, scripts, etc.)
- **TOOL USAGE**: Always use the `run_in_terminal` tool with all three required parameters: `command`, `explanation`, and `isBackground`
- **EFFICIENCY RULE**: Never repeat the same git command - trust your initial results and move forward decisively

**üìã FOR LARGE MULTI-FILE CHANGES**: If the combined diff is too large or complex, examine each file individually using:
```powershell
git --no-pager diff --no-prefix filename1
git --no-pager diff --no-prefix filename2
# etc. for each file shown in git stat
```

**2. RECURSION PREVENTION CHECK** - Applied automatically (see top of file)

**üéØ EXECUTION EFFICIENCY RULE**:
- **NEVER repeat git commands** - Each command should only be run ONCE during the review
- **Trust initial results** - Don't second-guess or re-verify git output
- **Efficient sequence**: status ‚Üí stat ‚Üí diff ‚Üí branch ‚Üí examine untracked files (if any)
- **Avoid redundancy**: If you already have the diff, don't run it again
- **Move forward decisively** with the information gathered from the first execution of each command

**üö® CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENT**:
The git stat output MUST be parsed correctly to count new/modified/deleted files accurately. Misclassifying deleted files as modified files is a critical error that undermines review credibility.

##  üìù **REVIEW OUTPUT FORMAT**

**Use this EXACT format for the review output:**

**3. ANALYZE THE FILE CHANGES** - Parse git status and diff output to get accurate file counts
- Parse `git status --porcelain` for complete change overview:
  - `??` prefix = Untracked files (NEW files not in git)
  - `M ` prefix = Modified files (tracked and changed)
  - `A ` prefix = Added files (staged new files)
  - `D ` prefix = Deleted files (staged deletions)
  - `MM` prefix = Modified file with both staged and unstaged changes
- Parse `git --no-pager diff --stat` for tracked file changes:
  - **CRITICAL**: Files showing only `------------------` (all minus signs) are DELETED files
  - **CRITICAL**: Files showing only `++++++++++++++++++` (all plus signs) are NEW tracked files
  - **CRITICAL**: Files showing both `+` and `-` are MODIFIED files
- **EXAMPLE git status**: `?? file.go` = UNTRACKED file (1 new untracked file)
- **EXAMPLE git stat**: `file.md | 505 -----------------` = DELETED file (1 deleted file)
- **EXAMPLE git stat**: `file.go | 25 +++++++++++++++++++++++++` = NEW tracked file (1 new file)
- **EXAMPLE git stat**: `file.go | 10 +++++++---` = MODIFIED file (1 modified file)
- Use this accurate classification in the CHANGE SUMMARY section

**4. REVIEW THE CHANGES** - Apply expertise as principal Terraform provider engineer

**üö® CRITICAL: Review ALL files shown in git stat output - do not miss any files!**

**5. PROVIDE STRUCTURED FEEDBACK** - Use the review format below

---

## üéØ **CORE REVIEW MISSION**

As a principal Terraform provider engineer with expertise in Go development, Azure APIs, and HashiCorp Plugin SDK, deliver actionable code review feedback.

**Critical Issues**:
- Security vulnerabilities in Azure authentication and API calls
- Resource lifecycle bugs (create, read, update, delete operations)
- State management and drift detection issues
- Azure API error handling and retry logic
- Resource import functionality correctness
- Terraform Plugin SDK usage violations
- Implementation approach consistency (Typed vs Untyped Resource Implementation)
- CustomizeDiff import pattern correctness (conditional import requirements)
- Resource schema validation and type safety

**Code Quality**:
- Go language conventions and idiomatic patterns
- Terraform resource implementation best practices
- Azure SDK for Go usage patterns
- Plugin SDK schema definitions and validation
- CustomizeDiff function validation logic and patterns
- Implementation approach appropriateness (Typed for new, Untyped maintenance only)
- Error handling and context propagation
- Resource timeout configurations
- Acceptance test coverage and quality
- **Tests use ONLY ExistsInAzure() check with ImportStep() - NO redundant field validation**
- **CRITICAL: Code comments policy enforcement - Comments only for Azure API quirks, complex business logic, or SDK workarounds that cannot be expressed through code structure**

**Documentation & Content Quality** *(Local Changes Focus)*:
- Spelling and grammar in all visible text
- Command examples accuracy and syntax
- Naming consistency across files
- Professional language standards
- Markdown formatting correctness
- Documentation template compliance

**Azure-Specific Concerns**:
- Azure API version compatibility
- Resource naming and tagging conventions
- Location/region handling
- Azure resource dependency management
- Subscription and resource group scoping
- Azure service-specific implementation patterns
- Resource ID parsing and validation

**Terraform Provider Patterns**:
- CRUD operation implementation correctness
- Schema design and nested resource handling
- ForceNew vs in-place update decisions
- CustomizeDiff function usage
- State refresh and conflict resolution
- Resource import state handling
- Documentation and example completeness

## üîç **VERIFICATION PROTOCOLS FOR LOCAL CHANGES**

**üö® CRITICAL: VERIFY BEFORE FLAGGING POLICY üö®**

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT**: NEVER flag formatting/encoding issues without verification. Console display artifacts are common and flagging them as critical issues wastes developer time and undermines review credibility.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Console Display Awareness**: Git diff output may wrap long lines. Use `read_file` to verify actual content before flagging display issues.

**Before flagging ANY formatting/encoding issues:**
1. **STOP** - Do not immediately flag suspicious formatting
2. **VERIFY FIRST** - Use read_file to check actual content
3. **ASSESS** - Console wrapping vs genuine issue
4. **RESPOND** - Only flag if genuinely broken after verification

**Zero Tolerance for False Positives**: False positive encoding/formatting flags are review failures that erode trust.

**Additional scope for local changes:**
- Spelling and grammar in visible text content
- Command syntax accuracy and consistency
- Professional standards in user-facing content
- Context quality in surrounding diff lines

## üîç **GIT DIFF OUTPUT INTERPRETATION**

**In the provided git diff output:**
- **Lines starting with `+`**: Added lines (new code)
- **Lines starting with `-`**: Removed lines (deleted code)
- **Lines starting with ` `** (space): Unchanged lines (context)
- **Lines starting with `@@`**: Hunk headers showing line numbers and context
- **Git stat symbols**:
  - `------------------` (all dashes): File was deleted
  - `++++++++++++++++++` (all pluses): File was added
  - Mixed `+` and `-`: File was modified

**Example git stat interpretation:**
```
file1.go                    |  10 +++++++---
file2.go                    |  25 -------------------------  # DELETED FILE
file3.go                    |  15 +++++++++++++++  # NEW FILE
```

# üìö **LOCAL DEVELOPMENT FOCUS** *(Additional Context)*

**Local changes review emphasizes:**
- **Iterative feedback** for work-in-progress code
- **Development guidance** before commit readiness
- **Verification protocols** to prevent false positives from console display issues
- **Comprehensive scope** including spelling/grammar in visible content
- **Next steps clarity** for continued development

**Key Differences from Committed Changes Review:**
- More detailed verification for display artifacts
- Development-focused output format vs executive summary
- Emphasis on "before commit" actions vs "before merge" decisions
- Broader content quality scope for documentation and examples

# üìö **APPENDIX: EDGE CASE HANDLING** *(Secondary Guidelines)*

## Console Line Wrapping Detection *(If Needed)*

**üö® CRITICAL: CONSOLE LINE WRAPPING DETECTION POLICY üö®**

**CONSOLE LINE WRAPPING WARNING**: When reviewing `git` diff output in terminal/console, be aware that long lines may wrap and appear malformed. Always verify actual file content for syntax validation, especially for `JSON`, `YAML`, or structured data files. Console wrapping can make valid syntax appear broken.

**VERIFICATION PROTOCOL FOR SUSPECTED ISSUES**:

üîç **MANDATORY VERIFICATION STEPS:**
1. **STOP** - If text appears broken/fragmented, this is likely console wrapping
2. **VERIFY** - Use `Get-Content filename` (PowerShell) or `cat filename` (bash) to check actual file content
3. **VALIDATE** - For JSON/structured files: `Get-Content file.json | ConvertFrom-Json` (PowerShell) or `jq "." file.json` (bash)

### üö® **Console Wrapping Red Flags:**
- ‚ùå Text breaks mid-sentence or mid-word without logical reason
- ‚ùå Missing closing quotes/brackets that don't make sense contextually
- ‚ùå Fragmented lines that appear to continue elsewhere in the diff
- ‚ùå Content looks syntactically invalid but conceptually correct
- ‚ùå Long lines in git diff output that suddenly break

### ‚úÖ **GOLDEN RULE**: If actual file content is valid ‚Üí acknowledge console wrapping ‚Üí do NOT flag as corruption

**üö´ COMMON REVIEW FAILURE**:
Flagging console display artifacts as "Critical: Encoding Issue" when actual file content is clean. This exact scenario wastes developer time and erodes review credibility.

**‚úÖ CORRECT APPROACH**:
1. See suspicious formatting in git diff ‚Üí Use read_file immediately
2. If content is clean ‚Üí Use ‚ÑπÔ∏è with ‚úÖ priority and verification emoji
3. Never flag as üî• Critical without confirming actual file corruption

## Verification Protocol *(Edge Cases Only)*

**When to verify:**
- Text breaks mid-word without logical reason
- Missing quotes/brackets that don't make contextual sense
- Emojis appear as `??`
- JSON/YAML looks syntactically broken

**Verification format:**
```markdown
## ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Console Display Verification**
* **Priority**: ‚úÖ
* **Details**: [What appeared wrong in git diff]
* **Verification**: Used read_file to check actual content
* **Result**: *(Verified: console wrapping - actual content clean)*
* **Assessment**: No action needed - normal console display artifact
```

**üö´ NEVER DO**: Flag encoding/formatting as üî• Critical without verification
**‚úÖ ALWAYS DO**: Verify first, then provide appropriate assessment with ‚úÖ emoji if clean

## Review Scope Expansion

**Beyond diff changes, also check:**
- Spelling and grammar in visible text
- Command examples accuracy
- Naming consistency
- Professional language standards

## Comprehensive Quality Guidelines

- **Code Comments Policy**: Comments only for Azure API quirks, complex business logic, or SDK workarounds that cannot be expressed through code structure
- **Comment Quality**: All comments must have clear justification and add genuine value beyond code structure
- **Refactoring Preference**: Consider if code restructuring could eliminate need for comments
- **Documentation Standards**: Ensure all user-facing documentation follows provider conventions and standards
