Add comments to the Go code in this Terraform AzureRM provider file to explain the purpose and functionality of each section, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the provider codebase.

Focus on documenting Azure resource behavior, Terraform lifecycle operations, and provider-specific patterns.
