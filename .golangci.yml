    #### DISABLED TO DO IN ITS OWN PR - should be enabled and done #####
    #- tenv #detects using os.Setenv instead of t.Setenv since Go1.17.

    #### REQUIRES GO 1.22 #####
    #- copyloopvar #Detects range loop variables that are overwritten in the loop body

    #### DISABLED till %+v -> %w #####
    #- err113 #Go linter to check the errors handling expressions. - disabled as it suggests (correctly?) to use %w in fmt.Errorf instead of %+v (1000s of usages in the codebase)
    #- errorlint #### DISABLED till %+v -> %w ##### #Errorlint is a linter for that can be used to find code that will cause problems with the error wrapping scheme used in the github.com/pkg/errors package.

    # disabled as it may be useful but there are a lot of switch statements in the codebase with unhandled inputs
    #- exhaustive #Check for missing cases in select statements

    ###### DISABLED because golang will put the space back into //nolint: linter ######
    #- nolintlint  #Reports ill-formed or insufficient nolint directives.

    # Disabled for performance reasons - Ignores cache and takes 12+ minutes to run on the repo for _any_ change
    #- whitespace #checks for unnecessary newlines at the start and end of functions, if, for, etc.
