## Developer Requirements

* [Terraform (Core)](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) - version 1.x (0.12.x and above are compatible however 1.x is recommended)
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.21.x (to build the provider plugin)

## Contributor Guides

A Collection of guides geared towards contributors can be found in the [`/contributing`](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/contributing) directory of this repository.

### On Windows

If you're on Windows you'll also need:

* [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)

For *GNU32 Make*, make sure its bin path is added to PATH environment variable.*

For *Git Bash for Windows*, at the step of "Adjusting your PATH environment", please choose "Use Git and optional Unix tools from Windows Command Prompt".*

Or install via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) (`Git Bash for Windows` must be installed per steps above)

```powershell
choco install make golang terraform -y
refreshenv
```

You must run `Developing the Provider` commands in `bash` because `sh` scrips are invoked as part of these.

You may hit issues with `make build` telling you every file needs to be formatted as a result of line endings. To avoid this issue set your git config using `git config --global core.autocrlf false`. This will tell git to use the source `LF` rather than the Windows default of `CRLF`.

You may get errors when cloning the repository on Windows that end with `Filename too long`. To avoid this issue set your git config using `git config --system core.longpaths true`. This will tell git to allow file names longer than 260 characters which is the default on Windows.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](https://go.dev/) installed on your machine. You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/go#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

First clone the repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp
$ git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm
```

Once inside the provider directory, you can run `make tools` to install the dependent tooling required to compile the provider.

At this point you can compile the provider by running `make build`, which will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-azurerm
...
```

You can also cross-compile if necessary:

```sh
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 make build
```

In order to run the `Unit Tests` for the provider, you can run:

```sh
$ make test
```

The majority of tests in the provider are `Acceptance Tests` - which provisions real resources in Azure. It's possible to run the entire acceptance test suite by running `make testacc` - however it's likely you'll want to run a subset, which you can do using a prefix, by running:

```sh
make acctests SERVICE='<service>' TESTARGS='-run=<nameOfTheTest>' TESTTIMEOUT='60m'
```

* `<service>` is the name of the folder which contains the file with the test(s) you want to run. The available folders are found in `azurerm/internal/services/`. So examples are `mssql`, `compute` or `mariadb`
* `<nameOfTheTest>` should be self-explanatory as it is the name of the test you want to run. An example could be `TestAccMsSqlServerExtendedAuditingPolicy_basic`. Since `-run` can be used with regular expressions you can use it to specify multiple tests like in `TestAccMsSqlServerExtendedAuditingPolicy_` to run all tests that match that expression

The following Environment Variables must be set in your shell prior to running acceptance tests:

- `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
- `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `ARM_TENANT_ID`
- `ARM_ENVIRONMENT`
- `ARM_METADATA_HOST`
- `ARM_TEST_LOCATION`
- `ARM_TEST_LOCATION_ALT`
- `ARM_TEST_LOCATION_ALT2`

**Note:** Acceptance tests create real resources in Azure which often cost money to run.

## Developer: Using the locally compiled Azure Provider binary

After successfully compiling the Azure Provider, you must [instruct Terraform to use your locally compiled provider binary](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers) instead of the official binary from the Terraform Registry.

For example, add the following to `~/.terraformrc` for a provider binary located in `/home/developer/go/bin`:

```hcl
provider_installation {

  # Use /home/developer/go/bin as an overridden package directory
  # for the hashicorp/azurerm provider. This disables the version and checksum
  # verifications for this provider and forces Terraform to look for the
  # azurerm provider plugin in the given directory.
  dev_overrides {
    "hashicorp/azurerm" = "/home/developer/go/bin"
  }

  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
```

## Developer: Generating Resource ID Formatters, Parsers and Validators

You can generate a Resource ID Formatter, Parser and Validator by adding the following line to a `resourceids.go` within each Service Package (for example `./internal/services/someservice/resourceids.go`):

```go
//go:generate go run ../../tools/generator-resource-id/main.go -path=./ -name=Server -id=/subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/resourceGroups/resGroup1/providers/Microsoft.AnalysisServices/servers/Server1
```

Where `name` is the name of the Resource ID Type - and `id` is an example Resource ID with placeholder data.

When `make generate` is run, this will then generate the following for this Resource ID:

* Resource ID Struct, containing the fields and a Formatter to convert this into a string - and the associated Unit Tests.
* Resource ID Parser (`./parse/{name}.go`) - to be able to parse a Resource ID into said struct - and the associated Unit Tests.
* Resource ID Validator (`./validate/{name}_id.go`) - to validate the Resource ID is what's expected (and not for a different resource) - and the associated Unit Tests.

## Developer: Scaffolding the Website Documentation

You can scaffold the documentation for a Data Source by running:

```sh
$ make scaffold-website BRAND_NAME="Resource Group" RESOURCE_NAME="azurerm_resource_group" RESOURCE_TYPE="data"
```

You can scaffold the documentation for a Resource by running:

```sh
$ make scaffold-website BRAND_NAME="Resource Group" RESOURCE_NAME="azurerm_resource_group" RESOURCE_TYPE="resource" RESOURCE_ID="/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1"
```
