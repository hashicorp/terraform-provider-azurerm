  name = "Reader"
}

resource "time_static" "example" {}

resource "azurerm_pim_eligible_role_assignment" "example" {
  scope              = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  role_definition_id = "${data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id}${data.azurerm_role_definition.example.id}"
  principal_id       = data.azurerm_client_config.example.object_id

  schedule {
    start_date_time = time_static.example.rfc3339
    expiration {
      duration_hours = 8
    }
  }

  justification = "Expiration Duration Set"

  ticket {
    number = "1"
    system = "example ticket system"
  }
}
```

## Import

PIM Eligible Role Assignments can be imported using the following composite resource ID, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_pim_eligible_role_assignment.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000|/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000|00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
```

-> **Note:** This ID is specific to Terraform - and is of the format `{scope}|{roleDefinitionId}|{principalId}`, where the first segment is the scope of the role assignment, the second segment is the role definition ID, and the last segment is the principal object ID.
