}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the HTTP Action to be created within the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **Note:** This name must be unique across all Actions within the Logic App Workflow.

* `logic_app_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `method` - (Required) Specifies the HTTP Method which should be used for this HTTP Action. Possible values include `DELETE`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST` and `PUT`.

* `uri` - (Required) Specifies the URI which will be called when this HTTP Action is triggered.

* `body` - (Optional) Specifies the HTTP Body that should be sent to the `uri` when this HTTP Action is triggered.

* `headers` - (Optional) Specifies a Map of Key-Value Pairs that should be sent to the `uri` when this HTTP Action is triggered.

* `queries` - (Optional) Specifies a Map of Key-Value Pairs that should be sent to the `uri` when this HTTP Action is triggered.

* `run_after` - (Optional) Specifies the place of the HTTP Action in the Logic App Workflow. If not specified, the HTTP Action is right after the Trigger. A `run_after` block is as defined below.

---

A `run_after` block supports the following:

* `action_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the precedent HTTP Action.

* `action_result` - (Required) Specifies the expected result of the precedent HTTP Action, only after which the current HTTP Action will be triggered. Possible values include `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Skipped` and `TimedOut`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the HTTP Action within the Logic App Workflow.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Logic App HTTP Action.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Logic App HTTP Action.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Logic App HTTP Action.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Logic App HTTP Action.

## Import

Logic App HTTP Actions can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_logic_app_action_http.webhook1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/workflow1/actions/webhook1
```

-> **Note:** This ID is unique to Terraform and doesn't directly match to any other resource. To compose this ID, you can take the ID Logic App Workflow and append `/actions/{name of the action}`.
