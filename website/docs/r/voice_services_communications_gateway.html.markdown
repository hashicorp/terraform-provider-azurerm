## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name which should be used for this Voice Services Communications Gateways. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the Azure Region where the Voice Services Communications Gateways should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Resource Group where the Voice Services Communications Gateways should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `connectivity` - (Required) How to connect back to the operator network, e.g. MAPS. Possible values is `PublicAddress`. Changing this forces a new Voice Services Communications Gateways to be created.

* `codecs` - (Required) The voice codecs expected for communication with Teams. Possible values are `PCMA`, `PCMU`,`G722`,`G722_2`,`SILK_8` and `SILK_16`.

* `e911_type` - (Required) How to handle 911 calls. Possible values are `Standard` and `DirectToEsrp`.

* `platforms` - (Required) The Voice Services Communications GatewaysAvailable supports platform types. Possible values are `OperatorConnect`, `TeamsPhoneMobile`.

* `service_location` - (Required) A `service_location` block as defined below.

* `auto_generated_domain_name_label_scope` - (Optional) Specifies the scope at which the auto-generated domain name can be re-used. Possible values are `TenantReuse`, `SubscriptionReuse`, `ResourceGroupReuse` and `NoReuse` . Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Defaults to `TenantReuse`.

* `api_bridge` - (Optional) Details of API bridge functionality, if required.

* `emergency_dial_strings` - (Optional) A list of dial strings used for emergency calling.

* `on_prem_mcp_enabled` - (Optional) Whether an on-premises Mobile Control Point is in use.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Voice Services Communications Gateways.

* `microsoft_teams_voicemail_pilot_number` - (Optional) This number is used in Teams Phone Mobile scenarios for access to the voicemail IVR from the native dialer.

A `service_location` block supports the following:

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the region in which the resources needed for Teams Calling will be deployed.

* `operator_addresses` - (Required) IP address to use to contact the operator network from this region.
