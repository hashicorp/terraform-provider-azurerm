# azurerm_private_endpoint

Manages a Private Endpoint.

Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that connects you privately and securely to a service powered by Azure Private Link. Private Endpoint uses a private IP address from your VNet, effectively bringing the service into your VNet. The service could be an Azure service such as Azure Storage, SQL, etc. or your own Private Link Service.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-network"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "service" {
  name                 = "service"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]

  enforce_private_link_service_network_policies = true
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "endpoint" {
  name                 = "endpoint"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]

  enforce_private_link_endpoint_network_policies = true
}

resource "azurerm_public_ip" "example" {
  name                = "example-pip"
  sku                 = "Standard"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  allocation_method   = "Static"
}

resource "azurerm_lb" "example" {
  name                = "example-lb"
  sku                 = "Standard"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = azurerm_public_ip.example.name
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.example.id
  }
}

resource "azurerm_private_link_service" "example" {
  name                = "example-privatelink"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  nat_ip_configuration {
    name      = azurerm_public_ip.example.name
    primary   = true
    subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.service.id
  }

  load_balancer_frontend_ip_configuration_ids = [
    azurerm_lb.example.frontend_ip_configuration[0].id,
  ]
}

resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "example" {
  name                = "example-endpoint"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.endpoint.id

  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "example-privateserviceconnection"
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_private_link_service.example.id
    is_manual_connection           = false
  }
}
```

Using a Private Link Service Alias with existing resources:

```hcl
data "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name = "example-resources"
}

data "azurerm_virtual_network" "vnet" {
  name                = "example-network"
  resource_group_name = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

data "azurerm_subnet" "subnet" {
  name                 = "default"
  virtual_network_name = data.azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name
  resource_group_name  = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_private_endpoint" "example" {
  name                = "example-endpoint"
  location            = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = data.azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id           = data.azurerm_subnet.subnet.id

  private_service_connection {
    name                              = "example-privateserviceconnection"
    private_connection_resource_alias = "example-privatelinkservice.d20286c8-4ea5-11eb-9584-8f53157226c6.centralus.azure.privatelinkservice"
    is_manual_connection              = true
    request_message                   = "PL"
  }
}
```

Using a Private Endpoint pointing to an *owned* Azure service, with proper DNS configuration:

  name     = "example-rg"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "exampleaccount"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "virtnetname"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                 = "subnetname"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name

  name                = "example-endpoint"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  subnet_id           = azurerm_subnet.example.id

  private_service_connection {
    name                           = "example-privateserviceconnection"
    private_connection_resource_id = azurerm_storage_account.example.id
    subresource_names              = ["blob"]
    is_manual_connection           = false
  }

  private_dns_zone_group {
    name                 = "example-dns-zone-group"
    private_dns_zone_ids = [azurerm_private_dns_zone.example.id]
  }
}

resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone" "example" {
  name                = "privatelink.blob.core.windows.net"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link" "example" {
  name                  = "example-link"
  resource_group_name   = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  private_dns_zone_name = azurerm_private_dns_zone.example.name
  virtual_network_id    = azurerm_virtual_network.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Resource Group within which the Private Endpoint should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the Subnet from which Private IP Addresses will be allocated for this Private Endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `custom_network_interface_name` - (Optional) The custom name of the network interface attached to the private endpoint. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `private_dns_zone_group` - (Optional) A `private_dns_zone_group` block as defined below.

* `private_service_connection` - (Required) A `private_service_connection` block as defined below.

* `ip_configuration` - (Optional) One or more `ip_configuration` blocks as defined below. This allows a static IP address to be set for this Private Endpoint, otherwise an address is dynamically allocated from the Subnet.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

A `private_dns_zone_group` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private DNS Zone Group.

* `private_dns_zone_ids` - (Required) Specifies the list of Private DNS Zones to include within the `private_dns_zone_group`.

---

A `private_service_connection` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the Private Service Connection. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `is_manual_connection` - (Required) Does the Private Endpoint require Manual Approval from the remote resource owner? Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** If you are trying to connect the Private Endpoint to a remote resource without having the correct RBAC permissions on the remote resource set this value to `true`.

* `private_connection_resource_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Private Link Enabled Remote Resource which this Private Endpoint should be connected to. One of `private_connection_resource_id` or `private_connection_resource_alias` must be specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. For a web app or function app slot, the parent web app should be used in this field instead of a reference to the slot itself.

* `private_connection_resource_alias` - (Optional) The Service Alias of the Private Link Enabled Remote Resource which this Private Endpoint should be connected to. One of `private_connection_resource_id` or `private_connection_resource_alias` must be specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `subresource_names` - (Optional) A list of subresource names which the Private Endpoint is able to connect to. `subresource_names` corresponds to `group_id`. Possible values are detailed in the product [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview#private-link-resource) in the `Subresources` column. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** Some resource types (such as Storage Account) only support 1 subresource per private endpoint.

* `request_message` - (Optional) A message passed to the owner of the remote resource when the private endpoint attempts to establish the connection to the remote resource. The provider allows a maximum request message length of `140` characters, however the request message maximum length is dependent on the service the private endpoint is connected to. Only valid if `is_manual_connection` is set to `true`.

-> **NOTE:** When connected to an SQL resource the `request_message` maximum length is `128`.

---

An `ip_configuration` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the Name of the IP Configuration. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `private_ip_address` - (Required) Specifies the static IP address within the private endpoint's subnet to be used. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `subresource_name` - (Optional) Specifies the subresource this IP address applies to. `subresource_names` corresponds to `group_id`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `member_name` - (Optional) Specifies the member name this IP address applies to. If it is not specified, it will use the value of `subresource_name`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** `member_name` will be required and will not take the value of `subresource_name` in the next major version.
