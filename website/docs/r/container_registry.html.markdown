# azurerm_container_registry

Manages an Azure Container Registry.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the access key will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_container_registry" "acr" {
  name                = "containerRegistry1"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  sku                 = "Premium"
  admin_enabled       = false
  georeplications {
    location                = "East US"
    zone_redundancy_enabled = true
    tags                    = {}
  }
  georeplications {
    location                = "North Europe"
    zone_redundancy_enabled = true
    tags                    = {}
  }
}
```

## Example Usage (Encryption)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_container_registry" "acr" {
  name                = "containerRegistry1"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  sku                 = "Premium"

  identity {
    type = "UserAssigned"
    identity_ids = [
      azurerm_user_assigned_identity.example.id
    ]
  }

  encryption {
    enabled            = true
    key_vault_key_id   = data.azurerm_key_vault_key.example.id
    identity_client_id = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.example.client_id
  }

}

resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "example" {
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  name = "registry-uai"
}

data "azurerm_key_vault_key" "example" {
  name         = "super-secret"
  key_vault_id = data.azurerm_key_vault.existing.id
}



```

## Example Usage (Attaching a Container Registry to a Kubernetes Cluster)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_container_registry" "example" {
  name                = "containerRegistry1"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  sku                 = "Premium"
}

resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name                = "example-aks1"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  dns_prefix          = "exampleaks1"

  default_node_pool {
    name       = "default"
    node_count = 1
    vm_size    = "Standard_D2_v2"
  }

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example" {
  principal_id                     = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.example.kubelet_identity[0].object_id
  role_definition_name             = "AcrPull"
  scope                            = azurerm_container_registry.example.id
  skip_service_principal_aad_check = true
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Container Registry. Only Alphanumeric characters allowed. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Container Registry. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. 

* `sku` - (Required) The SKU name of the container registry. Possible values are `Basic`, `Standard` and `Premium`.

* `admin_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether the admin user is enabled. Defaults to `false`.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

* `georeplications` - (Optional) A `georeplications` block as documented below.

~> **NOTE:** The `georeplications` is only supported on new resources with the `Premium` SKU.

~> **NOTE:** The `georeplications` list cannot contain the location where the Container Registry exists.

~> **NOTE:** If more than one `georeplications` block is specified, they are expected to follow the alphabetic order on the `location` property.

* `network_rule_set` - (Optional) A `network_rule_set` block as documented below.

## Import

Container Registries can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_container_registry.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.ContainerRegistry/registries/myregistry1
```
