# azurerm_workloads_sap_single_node_virtual_instance

Manages an SAP Single Node Virtual Instance with new SAP System.

-> **Note:** Before using this resource, it's required to submit the request of registering the Resource Provider with Azure CLI `az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.Workloads"`. The Resource Provider can take a while to register, you can check the status by running `az provider show --namespace "Microsoft.Workloads" --query "registrationState"`. Once this outputs "Registered" the Resource Provider is available for use.

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of this SAP Single Node Virtual Instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The Azure Region where the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `app_location` - (Required) The Geo-Location where the SAP system is to be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `environment` - (Required) The environment type for the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance. Possible values are `NonProd` and `Prod`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sap_fqdn` - (Required) The fully qualified domain name for the SAP system. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sap_product` - (Required) The SAP Product type for the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance. Possible values are `ECC`, `Other` and `S4HANA`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `single_server_configuration` - (Required) A `single_server_configuration` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `managed_resource_group_name` - (Optional) The name of the managed Resource Group for the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance.

---

A `single_server_configuration` block supports the following:

* `app_resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the application Resource Group where SAP system resources will be deployed. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **Note:** While creating an SAP Single Node Virtual Instance, the service will provision the extra SAP systems/components in the `app_resource_group_name` that are not defined in the HCL Configuration. At this time, if the `app_resource_group_name` is different from the Resource Group where SAP Single Node Virtual Instance exists, you can set `prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources` to `false` to delete all resources defined in the HCL Configuration and the resources created in the `app_resource_group_name` with `terraform destroy`. However, if the `app_resource_group_name` is the same with the Resource Group where SAP Single Node Virtual Instance exists, some resources, such as the subnet defined in the HCL Configuration, cannot be deleted with `terraform destroy` since the resources defined in the HCL Configuration are being referenced by the SAP system/component. In this case, you have to manually delete the SAP system/component before deleting the resources in the HCL Configuration.

* `subnet_id` - (Required) The resource ID of the Subnet for the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `virtual_machine_configuration` - (Required) A `virtual_machine_configuration` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `database_type` - (Optional) The supported SAP database type. Possible values are `DB2` and `HANA`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `disk_volume_configuration` - (Optional) One or more `disk_volume_configuration` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `secondary_ip_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether a secondary IP address should be added to the network interface on all VMs of the SAP system being deployed. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `virtual_machine_resource_names` - (Optional) A `virtual_machine_resource_names` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 60 minutes) Used when creating the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance with new SAP System.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance with new SAP System.
* `update` - (Defaults to 60 minutes) Used when updating the SAP Single Node Virtual Instance with new SAP System.
