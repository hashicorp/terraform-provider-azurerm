# azurerm_route_table

Manages a Route Table

~> **NOTE on Route Tables and Routes:** Terraform currently
provides both a standalone [Route resource](route.html), and allows for Routes to be defined in-line within the [Route Table resource](route_table.html).
At this time you cannot use a Route Table with in-line Routes in conjunction with any Route resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of Route configurations and will overwrite Routes.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_route_table" "example" {
  name                = "example-route-table"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  route {
    name           = "route1"
    address_prefix = "10.1.0.0/16"
    next_hop_type  = "VnetLocal"
  }

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the route table. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. 

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the route table. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `route` - (Optional) List of `route` objects representing routes as defined below. Each object accepts the arguments documented below.

-> **NOTE** Since `route` can be configured both inline and via the separate `azurerm_route` resource, we have to explicitly set it to empty slice (`[]`) to remove it.

* `bgp_route_propagation_enabled` - (Optional) Boolean flag which controls propagation of routes learned by BGP on that route table. Defaults to `true`.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

A `route` block support:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the route.

* `address_prefix` - (Required) The destination to which the route applies. Can be CIDR (such as `10.1.0.0/16`) or [Azure Service Tag](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview) (such as `ApiManagement`, `AzureBackup` or `AzureMonitor`) format.

* `next_hop_type` - (Required) The type of Azure hop the packet should be sent to. Possible values are `VirtualNetworkGateway`, `VnetLocal`, `Internet`, `VirtualAppliance` and `None`.

* `next_hop_in_ip_address` - (Optional) Contains the IP address packets should be forwarded to. Next hop values are only allowed in routes where the next hop type is `VirtualAppliance`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Route Table ID.
* `subnets` - The collection of Subnets associated with this route table.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Route Table.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Route Table.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Route Table.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Route Table.

## Import

Route Tables can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_route_table.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/routeTables/mytable1
```
