# azurerm_iothub

Manages an IotHub

~> **NOTE:** Endpoints can be defined either directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource, or using the `azurerm_iothub_endpoint_*` resources - but the two ways of defining the endpoints cannot be used together. If both are used against the same IoTHub, spurious changes will occur. Also, defining a `azurerm_iothub_endpoint_*` resource and another endpoint of a different type directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource is not supported.

~> **NOTE:** Routes can be defined either directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource, or using the `azurerm_iothub_route` resource - but the two cannot be used together. If both are used against the same IoTHub, spurious changes will occur.

~> **NOTE:** Enrichments can be defined either directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource, or using the `azurerm_iothub_enrichment` resource - but the two cannot be used together. If both are used against the same IoTHub, spurious changes will occur.

~> **NOTE:** Fallback route can be defined either directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource, or using the `azurerm_iothub_fallback_route` resource - but the two cannot be used together. If both are used against the same IoTHub, spurious changes will occur.

~> **NOTE:** File upload can be defined either directly on the `azurerm_iothub` resource, or using the `azurerm_iothub_file_upload` resource - but the two cannot be used together. If both are used against the same IoTHub, spurious changes will occur.
