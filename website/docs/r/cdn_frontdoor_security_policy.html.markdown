---

A `security_policies` block supports the following:

* `firewall` - (Required) An `firewall` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new Front Door Security Policy to be created.

---

A `firewall` block supports the following:

* `cdn_frontdoor_firewall_policy_id` - (Required) The Resource Id of the Front Door Firewall Policy that should be linked to this Front Door Security Policy. Changing this forces a new Front Door Security Policy to be created.

A `domain` block supports the following:

~> **NOTE:** The number of `domain` blocks that maybe included in the configuration file varies depending on the `sku_name` field of the linked Front Door Profile. The `Standard_AzureFrontDoor` sku may contain up to 100 `domain` blocks and a `Premium_AzureFrontDoor` sku may contain up to 500 `domain` blocks.

* `cdn_frontdoor_domain_id` - (Required) The Resource Id of the **Front Door Custom Domain** or **Front Door Endpoint** that should be bound to this Front Door Security Policy. Changing this forces a new Front Door Security Policy to be created.

* `active` - (Computed) Is the Front Door Custom Domain/Endpoint activated?
