# azurerm_batch_account

Manages an Azure Batch account.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "testbatch"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "teststorage"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_batch_account" "example" {
  name                                = "testbatchaccount"
  resource_group_name                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  pool_allocation_mode                = "BatchService"
  storage_account_id                  = azurerm_storage_account.example.id
  storage_account_authentication_mode = "StorageKeys"

  tags = {
    env = "test"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Batch account. Only lowercase Alphanumeric characters allowed. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Batch account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE:** To work around [a bug in the Azure API](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/issues/5574) this property is currently treated as case-insensitive. A future version of Terraform will require that the casing is correct.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `network_profile` - (Optional) A `network_profile` block as defined below.

* `pool_allocation_mode` - (Optional) Specifies the mode to use for pool allocation. Possible values are `BatchService` or `UserSubscription`. Defaults to `BatchService`.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - (Optional) Whether public network access is allowed for this server. Defaults to `true`.

~> **NOTE:** When using `UserSubscription` mode, an Azure KeyVault reference has to be specified. See `key_vault_reference` below.

~> **NOTE:** When using `UserSubscription` mode, the `Microsoft Azure Batch` service principal has to have `Contributor` role on your subscription scope, as documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/batch/batch-account-create-portal#additional-configuration-for-user-subscription-mode).

* `key_vault_reference` - (Optional) A `key_vault_reference` block, as defined below, that describes the Azure KeyVault reference to use when deploying the Azure Batch account using the `UserSubscription` pool allocation mode.

* `storage_account_id` - (Optional) Specifies the storage account to use for the Batch account. If not specified, Azure Batch will manage the storage.

~> **NOTE:** When using `storage_account_id`, the `storage_account_authentication_mode` must be specified as well.

* `storage_account_authentication_mode` - (Optional) Specifies the storage account authentication mode. Possible values include `StorageKeys`, `BatchAccountManagedIdentity`.

~> **NOTE:** When using `BatchAccountManagedIdentity` mod, the `identity.type` must set to `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned`.

* `storage_account_node_identity` - (Optional) Specifies the user assigned identity for the storage account.

* `allowed_authentication_modes` - (Optional) Specifies the allowed authentication mode for the Batch account. Possible values include `AAD`, `SharedKey` or `TaskAuthenticationToken`.

* `encryption` - (Optional) Specifies if customer managed key encryption should be used to encrypt batch account data. One `encryption` block as defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:
