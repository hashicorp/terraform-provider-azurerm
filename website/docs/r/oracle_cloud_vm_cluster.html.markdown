A `data_collection_options` block supports the following:

* `diagnostics_events_enabled` - (Optional) Indicates whether diagnostic collection is enabled for the VM Cluster/Cloud VM Cluster/VMBM DBCS. Enabling diagnostic collection allows you to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues. Diagnostic collection also allows Oracle to provide enhanced service and proactive support for your Exadata system. You can enable diagnostic collection during VM Cluster/Cloud VM Cluster provisioning. You can also disable or enable it at any time using the `UpdateVmCluster` or `updateCloudVmCluster` API. Changing this forces a new Cloud VM Cluster to be created.

* `health_monitoring_enabled` - (Optional) Indicates whether health monitoring is enabled for the VM Cluster / Cloud VM Cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling health monitoring allows Oracle to collect diagnostic data and share it with its operations and support personnel. You may also receive notifications for some events. Collecting health diagnostics enables Oracle to provide proactive support and enhanced service for your system. Optionally enable health monitoring while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable health monitoring anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `UpdateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. Changing this forces a new Cloud VM Cluster to be created.

* `incident_logs_enabled` - (Optional) Indicates whether incident logs and trace collection are enabled for the VM Cluster / Cloud VM Cluster / VMBM DBCS. Enabling incident logs collection allows Oracle to receive Events service notifications for guest VM issues, collect incident logs and traces, and use them to diagnose issues and resolve them. Optionally enable incident logs collection while provisioning a system. You can also disable or enable incident logs collection anytime using the `UpdateVmCluster`, `updateCloudVmCluster` or `updateDbsystem` API. Changing this forces a new Cloud VM Cluster to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported: 

* `id` - The ID of the Cloud VM Cluster.

* `hostname_actual` - The hostname for the Cloud VM Cluster with suffix.

* `ocid` - The [OCID](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Cloud VM Cluster.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 24 hours) Used when creating the Cloud VM Cluster.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Cloud VM Cluster.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Cloud VM Cluster.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Cloud VM Cluster.

## Import

Cloud VM Clusters can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_oracle_cloud_vm_cluster.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resourceGroup/providers/Oracle.Database/cloudVmClusters/cloudVmClusters1
