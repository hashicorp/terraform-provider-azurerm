}

resource "azurerm_recovery_services_vault" "example" {
  name                = "example-recovery-vault"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  sku                 = "Standard"
}

resource "azurerm_site_recovery_vmware_replication_policy" "example" {
  name = "example-policy"

  recovery_vault_id                                    = azurerm_recovery_services_vault.example.id
  recovery_point_retention_in_minutes                  = 1440
  application_consistent_snapshot_frequency_in_minutes = 240
}

resource "azurerm_site_recovery_vmware_replication_policy_association" "example" {
  name              = "example-association"
  recovery_vault_id = azurerm_recovery_services_vault.example.id
  policy_id         = azurerm_site_recovery_vmware_replication_policy.example.id
}
```
