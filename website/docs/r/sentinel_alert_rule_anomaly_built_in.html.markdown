# azurerm_sentinel_alert_rule_anomaly_built_in

Manages a Built-in Anomaly Alert Rule.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_log_analytics_workspace" "example" {
  name                = "example-law"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  sku                 = "PerGB2018"
}

resource "azurerm_sentinel_log_analytics_workspace_onboarding" "example" {
  workspace_id                 = azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.example.id
  customer_managed_key_enabled = false
}

data "azurerm_sentinel_alert_rule_anomaly" "example" {
  log_analytics_workspace_id = azurerm_sentinel_log_analytics_workspace_onboarding.example.workspace_id
  display_name               = "Potential data staging"
}

resource "azurerm_sentinel_alert_rule_anomaly_built_in" "example" {
  display_name               = "Potential data staging"
  log_analytics_workspace_id = azurerm_log_analytics_workspace.example.id
  mode                       = "Production"
  enabled                    = false
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional) The Name of the built-in Anomaly Alert Rule.

~> **Note:** One of `name` or `display_name` block must be specified.

* `log_analytics_workspace_id` - (Required) The ID of the Log Analytics Workspace. Changing this forces a new Built-in Anomaly Alert Rule to be created.

* `enabled` - (Required) Should the Built-in Anomaly Alert Rule be enabled?

* `mode` - (Required) mode of the Built-in Anomaly Alert Rule. Possible Values are `Production` and `Flighting`.

* `frequency` - The frequency the Anomaly Alert Rule will be run.

* `required_data_connector` - A `required_data_connector` block as defined below.

* `settings_definition_id` - The ID of the anomaly settings definition Id.

* `tactics` - A list of categories of attacks by which to classify the rule.

* `techniques` - A list of techniques of attacks by which to classify the rule.

* `multi_select_observation` - A list of `multi_select_observation` blocks as defined below.

* `single_select_observation` - A list of `single_select_observation` blocks as defined below.

* `prioritized_exclude_observation` - A list of `prioritized_exclude_observation` blocks as defined below.

* `threshold_observation` - A list of `threshold_observation` blocks as defined below.
