Because these policies are created automatically by Azure, they will auto-import on first use. They can be imported using the `resource id` of the role definition, combined with the scope id, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_role_management_policy.example "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000|<scope>"
```

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Role Definition.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Role Definition.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Role Definition.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when deleting the Role Definition.
