* `order` - (Required) The order in which the rules will be applied for the Front Door Endpoint. The order value should be sequential and begin at `1`(e.g. `1`, `2`, `3`...). A Front Door Rule with a lesser order value will be applied before a rule with a greater order value.

->**NOTE:** If the Front Door Rule has an order value of `0` they do not require any conditions and the actions will always be applied.

* `actions` - (Required) An `actions` block as defined below.

* `behavior_on_match` - (Optional) If this rule is a match should the rules engine continue processing the remaining rules or stop? Possible values are `Continue` and `Stop`. Defaults to `Continue`.

---

A `route_configuration_override_action` block supports the following:

->**NOTE:** In the v3.x of the provider the `cache_duration`, `cache_behavior` and `query_string_caching_behavior` will have default values. You can use Terraform's [ignore_changes](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle#ignore_changes) functionality to ignore these default values. In v4.0 of the provider the `cache_duration`, `cache_behavior` and `query_string_caching_behavior` will **NOT** have default values and will need to be explicitly set in the configuration file.

* `cache_duration` - (Optional) When Cache behavior is set to `Override` or `SetIfMissing`, this field specifies the cache duration to use. The maximum duration is 366 days specified in the `d.HH:MM:SS` format(e.g. `365.23:59:59`).

Possible values include `IgnoreQueryString`, `UseQueryString`, `IgnoreSpecifiedQueryStrings` or `IncludeSpecifiedQueryStrings`.

* `query_string_parameters` - (Optional) A list of query string parameter names.

->**NOTE:** `query_string_parameters` is a required field when the `query_string_caching_behavior` is set to `IncludeSpecifiedQueryStrings` or `IgnoreSpecifiedQueryStrings`.

* `compression_enabled` - (Optional) Should the Front Door dynamically compress the content? Possible values include `true` or `false`.

->**NOTE:** Content won't be compressed on AzureFrontDoor when requested content is smaller than `1 byte` or larger than `1 MB`.

* `cache_behavior` - (Optional) `HonorOrigin` the Front Door will always honor origin response header directive. If the origin directive is missing, Front Door will cache contents anywhere from `1` to `3` days. `OverrideAlways` the TTL value returned from your Front Door Origin is overwritten with the value specified in the action. This behavior will only be applied if the response is cacheable. `OverrideIfOriginMissing` if no TTL value gets returned from your Front Door Origin, the rule sets the TTL to the value specified in the action. This behavior will only be applied if the response is cacheable. `Disabled` the Front Door will not cache the response contents, irrespective of Front Door Origin response directives. Possible values include `HonorOrigin`, `OverrideAlways`, `OverrideIfOriginMissing` or `Disabled`.

---

An `url_rewrite_action` block supports the following:

* `preserve_unmatched_path` - (Optional) Append the remaining path after the source pattern to the new destination path? Possible values `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`.

---

A `request_header_action` block supports the following:

* `header_action` - (Required) The action to be taken on the specified `header_name`. Possible values include `Append`, `Overwrite` or `Delete`.

## Specifying IP Address Ranges

When specifying IP address ranges in the `socket_address_condition` and the `remote_address_condition` `match_values` use the following format:

Use `CIDR` notation when specifying IP address blocks. This means that the syntax for an IP address block is the base IP address followed by a forward slash and the prefix size For example:

* `IPv4` example: `5.5.5.64/26` matches any requests that arrive from addresses `5.5.5.64` through `5.5.5.127`.
* `IPv6` example: `1:2:3:/48` matches any requests that arrive from addresses `1:2:3:0:0:0:0:0` through `1:2:3:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`.

When you specify multiple IP addresses and IP address blocks, `OR` logic is applied.

* `IPv4` example: if you add two IP addresses `1.2.3.4` and `10.20.30.40`, the condition is matched for any requests that arrive from either address `1.2.3.4` or `10.20.30.40`.
* `IPv6` example: if you add two IP addresses `1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8` and `10:20:30:40:50:60:70:80`, the condition is matched for any requests that arrive from either address `1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8` or `10:20:30:40:50:60:70:80`.

## Action Server Variables

Rule Set server variables provide access to structured information about the request. You can use server variables to dynamically change the request/response headers or URL rewrite paths/query strings, for example, when a new page load or when a form is posted.

### Supported Action Server Variables

| Variable name | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `socket_ip`      | The IP address of the direct connection to Front Door Profiles edge. If the client used an HTTP proxy or a load balancer to send the request, the value of `socket_ip` is the IP address of the proxy or load balancer. |
| `client_ip`      | The IP address of the client that made the original request. If there was an `X-Forwarded-For` header in the request, then the client IP address is picked from the header. |
| `client_port`    | The IP port of the client that made the request. |
| `hostname`       | The host name in the request from the client. |
| `geo_country`    | Indicates the requester's country/region of origin through its country/region code. |
| `http_method`    | The method used to make the URL request, such as `GET` or `POST`. |
| `http_version`   | The request protocol. Usually `HTTP/1.0`, `HTTP/1.1`, or `HTTP/2.0`. |
| `query_string`   | The list of variable/value pairs that follows the "?" in the requested URL. For example, in the request `http://contoso.com:8080/article.aspx?id=123&title=fabrikam`, the `query_string` value will be `id=123&title=fabrikam`. |
| `request_scheme` | The request scheme: `http` or `https`. |
| `request_uri`    | The full original request URI (with arguments). For example, in the request `http://contoso.com:8080/article.aspx?id=123&title=fabrikam`, the `request_uri` value will be `/article.aspx?id=123&title=fabrikam`. |
| `ssl_protocol`   | The protocol of an established TLS connection. |
| `server_port`    | The port of the server that accepted a request. |
| `url_path`       | Identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. This is the part of the request URI without the arguments. For example, in the request `http://contoso.com:8080/article.aspx?id=123&title=fabrikam`, the `uri_path` value will be `/article.aspx`. |

### Action Server Variable Format

Server variables can be specified using the following formats:

* `{variable}` - Include the entire server variable. For example, if the client IP address is `111.222.333.444` then the `{client_ip}` token would evaluate to `111.222.333.444`.

* `{variable:offset}` - Include the server variable after a specific offset, until the end of the variable. The offset is zero-based. For example, if the client IP address is `111.222.333.444` then the `{client_ip:3}` token would evaluate to `.222.333.444`.

* `{variable:offset:length}` - Include the server variable after a specific offset, up to the specified length. The offset is zero-based. For example, if the client IP address is `111.222.333.444` then the `{client_ip:4:3}` token would evaluate to `222`.

### Action Server Variables Support

Action Server variables are supported on the following actions:

* `route_configuration_override_action`
* `request_header_action`
* `response_header_action`
* `url_redirect_action`
* `url_rewrite_action`
