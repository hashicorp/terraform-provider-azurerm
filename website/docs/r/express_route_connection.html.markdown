# azurerm_express_route_connection

Manages an Express Route Connection.

~> **NOTE:** The provider status of the Express Route Circuit must be set as provisioned while creating the Express Route Connection. See more details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/expressroute/expressroute-howto-circuit-portal-resource-manager#send-the-service-key-to-your-connectivity-provider-for-provisioning).

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Express Route Connection. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `express_route_circuit_peering_id` - (Required) The ID of the Express Route Circuit Peering that this Express Route Connection connects with. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `express_route_gateway_id` - (Required) The ID of the Express Route Gateway that this Express Route Connection connects with. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `authorization_key` - (Optional) The authorization key to establish the Express Route Connection.

* `enable_internet_security` - (Optional) Is Internet security enabled for this Express Route Connection?

* `express_route_gateway_bypass_enabled` - (Optional) Specified whether Fast Path is enabled for Virtual Wan Firewall Hub. Defaults to `false`.

* `routing` - (Optional) A `routing` block as defined below.

* `routing_weight` - (Optional) The routing weight associated to the Express Route Connection. Possible value is between `0` and `32000`. Defaults to `0`.

---

A `routing` block supports the following:

* `associated_route_table_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Virtual Hub Route Table associated with this Express Route Connection.

* `inbound_route_map_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Route Map associated with this Express Route Connection for inbound routes.
 
* `outbound_route_map_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Route Map associated with this Express Route Connection for outbound routes.

* `propagated_route_table` - (Optional) A `propagated_route_table` block as defined below.

---

A `propagated_route_table` block supports the following:

* `labels` - (Optional) The list of labels to logically group route tables.

* `route_table_ids` - (Optional) A list of IDs of the Virtual Hub Route Table to propagate routes from Express Route Connection to the route table.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Express Route Connection.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Express Route Connection.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Express Route Connection.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Express Route Connection.
