# azurerm_logic_app_trigger_custom

Manages a Custom Trigger within a Logic App Workflow

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "workflow-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_logic_app_workflow" "example" {
  name                = "workflow1"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_logic_app_trigger_custom" "example" {
  name         = "example-trigger"
  logic_app_id = azurerm_logic_app_workflow.example.id

  body = <<BODY
{
  "recurrence": {
    "frequency": "Day",
    "interval": 1
  },
  "type": "Recurrence"
}
BODY

}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the HTTP Trigger to be created within the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** This name must be unique across all Triggers within the Logic App Workflow.

* `logic_app_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `body` - (Required) Specifies the JSON Blob defining the Body of this Custom Trigger.

-> **NOTE:** To make the Trigger more readable, you may wish to consider using HEREDOC syntax (as shown above) or [the `local_file` resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/local/d/file.html) to load the schema from a file on disk.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Trigger within the Logic App Workflow.

* `callback_url` - The URL of the Trigger within the Logic App Workflow. For use with certain resources like [monitor_action_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/monitor_action_group) and [security_center_automation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/security_center_automation).

-> **NOTE:** `callback_url` is populated for [Triggers with a type of](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-workflow-actions-triggers#trigger-types-list) HTTPWebhook, Request, or ApiConnectionWebhook. For all other Trigger types, `callback_url` will be empty and should not be referenced.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Logic App Custom Trigger.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Logic App Custom Trigger.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Logic App Custom Trigger.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Logic App Custom Trigger.

## Import

Logic App Custom Triggers can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_logic_app_trigger_custom.custom1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/workflow1/triggers/custom1
```

-> **NOTE:** This ID is unique to Terraform and doesn't directly match to any other resource. To compose this ID, you can take the ID Logic App Workflow and append `/triggers/{name of the trigger}`.
