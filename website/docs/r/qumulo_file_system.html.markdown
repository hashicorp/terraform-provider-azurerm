## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-vnet"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                 = "example-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.1.0/24"]

  delegation {
    name = "delegation"
    service_delegation {
      actions = ["Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action"]
      name    = "Qumulo.Storage/fileSystems"
    }
  }
}

resource "azurerm_qumulo_file_system" "example" {
  name                = "example"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  admin_password      = ")^X#ZX#JRyIY}t9"
  availability_zone   = "1"
  delegated_subnet_id = azurerm_subnet.example.id
  storage_sku         = "Standard"
