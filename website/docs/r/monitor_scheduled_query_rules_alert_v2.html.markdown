-> **Note** `evaluation_frequency` cannot be greater than the `mute_actions_after_alert_duration`.

* `scopes` - (Required) Specifies the list of resource IDs that this scheduled query rule is scoped to. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Currently, the API supports exactly 1 resource ID in the scopes list.

* `query_time_range_override` - (Optional) Set this if the alert evaluation period is different from the query time range. If not specified, the value is `window_duration`*`number_of_evaluation_periods`. Possible values are `PT5M`, `PT10M`, `PT15M`, `PT20M`, `PT30M`, `PT45M`, `PT1H`, `PT2H`, `PT3H`, `PT4H`, `PT5H`, `PT6H`, `P1D` and `P2D`.
