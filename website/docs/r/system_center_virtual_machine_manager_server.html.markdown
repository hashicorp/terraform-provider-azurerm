# azurerm_system_center_virtual_machine_manager_server

Manages a System Center Virtual Machine Manager Server.

~> **Note:** By request of the service team the provider no longer automatically registering the `Microsoft.ScVmm` Resource Provider for this resource. To register it you can run `az provider register --namespace Microsoft.ScVmm`.

-> **Note:** This resource depends on an existing `System Center Virtual Machine Manager Host Machine`, `Arc Resource Bridge` and `Custom Location`. Installing and configuring these dependencies is outside the scope of this document. See [Virtual Machine Manager documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/vmm/?view=sc-vmm-2022) and [Install VMM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/vmm/install?view=sc-vmm-2022) for more details of `System Center Virtual Machine Manager Host Machine`. See [What is Azure Arc resource bridge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/resource-bridge/overview) and [Overview of Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/system-center-virtual-machine-manager/overview) for more details of `Arc Resource Bridge/Appliance`. See [Create and manage custom locations on Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/custom-locations) for more details of `Custom Location`. If you encounter issues while configuring, we'd recommend opening a ticket with Microsoft Support.
