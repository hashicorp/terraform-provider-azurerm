* `location` - (Required) Specifies the Azure Region where the Alert Management Prometheus Rule Group should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Resource Group where the Alert Management Prometheus Rule Group should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `rule` - (Required) A `rule` block as defined below.

* `scopes` - (Required) Specifies the resource ID of the Azure Monitor Workspace.

* `cluster_name` - (Optional) Specifies the name of the Managed Kubernetes Cluster.

* `description` - (Optional) The description of the Alert Management Prometheus Rule Group.

* `rule_group_enabled` - (Optional) Is this Alert Management Prometheus Rule Group enabled? Possible values are `true` and `false`.

* `interval` - (Optional) Specifies the interval in which to run the Alert Management Prometheus Rule Group represented in ISO 8601 duration format. Possible values are between `PT1M` and `PT15M`.
