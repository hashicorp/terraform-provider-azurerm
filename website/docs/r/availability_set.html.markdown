resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_availability_set" "example" {
  name                = "example-aset"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the availability set. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the availability set. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `platform_update_domain_count` - (Optional) Specifies the number of update domains that are used. Defaults to `5`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE:** The number of Update Domains varies depending on which Azure Region you're using. More information about update and fault domains and how they work can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/availability-set-overview).

* `platform_fault_domain_count` - (Optional) Specifies the number of fault domains that are used. Defaults to `3`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `proximity_placement_group_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Proximity Placement Group to which this Virtual Machine should be assigned. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `managed` - (Optional) Specifies whether the availability set is managed or not. Possible values are `true` (to specify aligned) or `false` (to specify classic). Default is `true`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
