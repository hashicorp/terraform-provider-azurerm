## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Express Route Circuit Connection. Changing this forces a new Express Route Circuit Connection to be created.

* `peering_id` - (Required) The ID of the Express Route Circuit Private Peering that this Express Route Circuit Connection connects with. Changing this forces a new Express Route Circuit Connection to be created.
  
* `peer_peering_id` - (Required) The ID of the peered Express Route Circuit Private Peering. Changing this forces a new Express Route Circuit Connection to be created.

* `address_prefix_ipv4` - (Required) The IPv4 address space from which to allocate customer address for global reach. Changing this forces a new Express Route Circuit Connection to be created.

---

* `authorization_key` - (Optional) The authorization key which is associated with the Express Route Circuit Connection.

* `address_prefix_ipv6` - (Optional) The IPv6 address space from which to allocate customer addresses for global reach.

-> **Note:** `address_prefix_ipv6` cannot be set when ExpressRoute Circuit Connection with ExpressRoute Circuit based on ExpressRoute Port.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Express Route Circuit Connection.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Express Route Circuit Connection.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Express Route Circuit Connection.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Express Route Circuit Connection.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Express Route Circuit Connection.

## Import

Express Route Circuit Connections can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_express_route_circuit_connection.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits/circuit1/peerings/peering1/connections/connection1
```
