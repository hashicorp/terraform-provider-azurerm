## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Machine Learning Compute Instance. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `machine_learning_workspace_id` - (Required) The ID of the Machine Learning Workspace. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `virtual_machine_size` - (Required) The Virtual Machine Size. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

---

* `location` - (Optional) The Azure Region where the Machine Learning Compute Instance should exist.

-> **Note:** The `location` field is not supported for Machine Learning Compute Instances and has no effect so as such will be removed in v4.0 of the AzureRM provider. For more information, please see the product [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-attach-compute-cluster?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=python).

* `authorization_type` - (Optional) The Compute Instance Authorization type. Possible values include: `personal`. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `assign_to_user` - (Optional) A `assign_to_user` block as defined below. A user explicitly assigned to a personal compute instance. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `description` - (Optional) The description of the Machine Learning Compute Instance. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `local_auth_enabled` - (Optional) Whether local authentication methods is enabled. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `ssh` - (Optional) A `ssh` block as defined below. Specifies policy and settings for SSH access. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `subnet_resource_id` - (Optional) Virtual network subnet resource ID the compute nodes belong to. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

* `node_public_ip_enabled` - (Optional) Whether the compute instance will have a public ip. To set this to false a `subnet_resource_id` needs to be set. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Cluster to be created.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Machine Learning Compute Instance. Changing this forces a new Machine Learning Compute Instance to be created.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of Managed Service Identity that should be configured on this Machine Learning Compute Instance. Possible values are `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned` (to enable both). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `identity_ids` - (Optional) Specifies a list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs to be assigned to this Machine Learning Compute Instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE:** This is required when `type` is set to `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned`.

---

A `assign_to_user` block supports the following:

* `object_id` - (Optional) User’s AAD Object Id.

* `tenant_id` - (Optional) User’s AAD Tenant Id.

---

A `ssh` block supports the following:

* `public_key` - (Required) Specifies the SSH rsa public key file as a string. Use "ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048" to generate your SSH key pairs.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Machine Learning Compute Instance.

* `identity` - An `identity` block as defined below, which contains the Managed Service Identity information for this Machine Learning Compute Instance.

* `ssh` - An `ssh` block as defined below, which specifies policy and settings for SSH access for this Machine Learning Compute Instance.

---

A `identity` block exports the following:

* `principal_id` - The Principal ID for the Service Principal associated with the Managed Service Identity of this Machine Learning Compute Instance.

* `tenant_id` - The Tenant ID for the Service Principal associated with the Managed Service Identity of this Machine Learning Compute Instance.

---
A `ssh` block exports the following:

* `username` - The admin username of this Machine Learning Compute Instance.

* `port` - Describes the port for connecting through SSH.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Machine Learning Compute Instance.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Machine Learning Compute Instance.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Machine Learning Compute Instance.

## Import

Machine Learning Compute Instances can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_machine_learning_compute_instance.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resGroup1/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/workspace1/computes/compute1
```
