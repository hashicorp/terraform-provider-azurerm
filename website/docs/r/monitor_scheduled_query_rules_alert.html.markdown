# azurerm_monitor_scheduled_query_rules_alert

Manages an AlertingAction Scheduled Query Rules resource within Azure Monitor.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "monitoring-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_application_insights" "example" {
  name                = "appinsights"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  application_type    = "web"
}

resource "azurerm_application_insights" "example2" {
  name                = "appinsights2"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  application_type    = "web"
}

# Example: Alerting Action with result count trigger
resource "azurerm_monitor_scheduled_query_rules_alert" "example" {
  name                = "example"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  action {
    action_group           = []
    email_subject          = "Email Header"
    custom_webhook_payload = "{}"
  }
  data_source_id = azurerm_application_insights.example.id
  description    = "Alert when total results cross threshold"
  enabled        = true
  # Count all requests with server error result code grouped into 5-minute bins
  query       = <<-QUERY
  requests
    | where tolong(resultCode) >= 500
    | summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 5m)
  QUERY
  severity    = 1
  frequency   = 5
  time_window = 30
  trigger {
    operator  = "GreaterThan"
    threshold = 3
  }
  tags = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}

# Example: Alerting Action Cross-Resource
resource "azurerm_monitor_scheduled_query_rules_alert" "example2" {
  name                = "example"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  authorized_resource_ids = [azurerm_application_insights.example2.id]
  action {
    action_group           = []
    email_subject          = "Email Header"
    custom_webhook_payload = "{}"
  }
  data_source_id = azurerm_application_insights.example.id
  description    = "Query may access data within multiple resources"
  enabled        = true
  # Count requests in multiple log resources and group into 5-minute bins by HTTP operation
  query = format(<<-QUERY
  let a=requests
    | where toint(resultCode) >= 500
    | extend fail=1; let b=app('%s').requests
    | where toint(resultCode) >= 500 | extend fail=1; a
    | join b on fail
QUERY
  , azurerm_application_insights.example2.id)
  severity    = 1
  frequency   = 5
  time_window = 30
  trigger {
    operator  = "GreaterThan"
    threshold = 3
  }
  tags = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the scheduled query rule. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the scheduled query rule instance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `location` - (Required) Specifies the Azure Region where the resource should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `data_source_id` - (Required) The resource URI over which log search query is to be run. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
* `frequency` - (Required) Frequency (in minutes) at which rule condition should be evaluated. Values must be between 5 and 1440 (inclusive).
* `query` - (Required) Log search query.
* `time_window` - (Required) Time window for which data needs to be fetched for query (must be greater than or equal to `frequency`). Values must be between 5 and 2880 (inclusive).
* `trigger` - (Required) A `trigger` block as defined below.
* `action` - (Required) An `action` block as defined below.
* `authorized_resource_ids` - (Optional) List of Resource IDs referred into query.
* `auto_mitigation_enabled` - (Optional) Should the alerts in this Metric Alert be auto resolved? Defaults to `false`.
-> **NOTE** `auto_mitigation_enabled` and `throttling` are mutually exclusive and cannot both be set.
* `description` - (Optional) The description of the scheduled query rule.
* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether this scheduled query rule is enabled. Default is `true`.
* `query_type` - (Optional) The type of query results. Possible values are `ResultCount` and `Number`. Default is `ResultCount`. If set to `ResultCount`, `query` must include an `AggregatedValue` column of a numeric type, for example, `Heartbeat | summarize AggregatedValue = count() by bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)`.
* `severity` - (Optional) Severity of the alert. Possible values include: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
* `throttling` - (Optional) Time (in minutes) for which Alerts should be throttled or suppressed. Values must be between 0 and 10000 (inclusive).

* `operator` - (Required) Evaluation operation for rule - 'GreaterThan', GreaterThanOrEqual', 'LessThan', or 'LessThanOrEqual'.
* `threshold` - (Required) Result or count threshold based on which rule should be triggered. Values must be between 0 and 10000 inclusive.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the scheduled query rule.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Scheduled Query Rule Alert.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Scheduled Query Rule Alert.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Scheduled Query Rule Alert.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Scheduled Query Rule Alert.

## Import

Scheduled Query Rule Alerts can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_monitor_scheduled_query_rules_alert.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Insights/scheduledQueryRules/myrulename
