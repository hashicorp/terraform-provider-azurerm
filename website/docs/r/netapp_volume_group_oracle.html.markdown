## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `account_name` - (Required) Name of the account where the application volume group belong to. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `application_identifier` - (Required) The SAP System ID, maximum 3 characters, e.g. `OR1`. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `group_description` - (Required) Volume group description. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `location` - (Required) The Azure Region where the Application Volume Group should exist. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Application Volume Group. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Application Volume Group should exist. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `volume` - (Required) One or more `volume` blocks as defined below.

---

A `volume` block supports the following:

* `capacity_pool_id` - (Required) The ID of the Capacity Pool. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this volume. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `protocols` - (Required) The target volume protocol expressed as a list. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost. Supported values for Application Volume Group include `NFSv3` or `NFSv4.1`.

* `proximity_placement_group_id` - (Optional) The ID of the proximity placement group (PPG). Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost. 

~> **NOTE**: For Oracle application, it is required to have PPG enabled so Azure NetApp Files can pin the volumes next to your compute resources, please check [Requirements and considerations for application volume group for Oracle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/application-volume-group-oracle-considerations) for details and other requirements. Note that this cannot be used together with `zone`.

* `zone` - (Optional) Specifies the Availability Zone in which the Volume should be located. Possible values are `1`, `2` and `3`, depending on the Azure region. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. This feature is currently in preview, for more information on how to enable it, please refer to [Manage availability zone volume placement for Azure NetApp Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/manage-availability-zone-volume-placement). Note that this cannot be used together with `proximity_placement_group_id`.

* `security_style` - (Required) Volume security style. Possible values are `ntfs` and `unix`. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `service_level` - (Required) Volume security style. Possible values are `Premium`, `Standard` and `Ultra`. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `snapshot_directory_visible` - (Required) Specifies whether the .snapshot (NFS clients) path of a volume is visible. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `storage_quota_in_gb` - (Required) The maximum Storage Quota allowed for a file system in Gigabytes.

* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the Subnet the NetApp Volume resides in, which must have the `Microsoft.NetApp/volumes` delegation. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `throughput_in_mibps` - (Required) Throughput of this volume in Mibps.

* `volume_path` - (Required) A unique file path for the volume. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `volume_spec_name` - (Required) Volume specification name. Possible values are `ora-data1` through `ora-data8`, `ora-log`, `ora-log-mirror`, `ora-backup` and `ora-binary`. Changing this forces a new Application Volume Group to be created and data will be lost.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Application Volume Group.

* `network_features` - (Optional) Indicates which network feature to use, accepted values are `Basic` or `Standard`, it defaults to `Basic` if not defined. This is a feature in public preview and for more information about it and how to register, please refer to [Configure network features for an Azure NetApp Files volume](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/configure-network-features). This is required if enabling customer managed keys encryption scenario.

* `encryption_key_source` - (Optional) The encryption key source, it can be `Microsoft.NetApp` for platform managed keys or `Microsoft.KeyVault` for customer-managed keys. This is required with `key_vault_private_endpoint_id`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported: 

* `id` - The ID of the Application Volume Group.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 90 minutes) Used when creating the Application Volume Group.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Application Volume Group.
* `update` - (Defaults to 2 hours) Used when updating the Application Volume Group.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 2 hours) Used when deleting the Application Volume Group.

## Import

Application Volume Groups can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_netapp_volume_group_oracle.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mytest-rg/providers/Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/netapp-account-test/volumeGroups/netapp-volumegroup-test
```
