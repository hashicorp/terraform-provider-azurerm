  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_recovery_services_vault" "example" {
  name                = "tfex-recovery-vault"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  timezone = "UTC"

  backup {
    frequency = "Daily"
    time      = "23:00"
  }

  retention_daily {
    count = 10
  }

  retention_weekly {
    count    = 7
    weekdays = ["Sunday", "Wednesday", "Friday", "Saturday"]
