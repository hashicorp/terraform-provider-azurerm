}

resource "azurerm_cognitive_deployment" "example" {
  name                 = "example-cd"
  cognitive_account_id = azurerm_cognitive_account.example.id
  model {
    format  = "OpenAI"

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Cognitive Services Account Deployment. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `cognitive_account_id` - (Required) The ID of the Cognitive Services Account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `model` - (Required) A `model` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `scale` - (Required) A `scale` block as defined below.

* `rai_policy_name` - (Optional) The name of RAI policy.

* `version_upgrade_option` - (Optional) Deployment model version upgrade option. Possible values are `OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable`, `OnceCurrentVersionExpired`, and `NoAutoUpgrade`. Defaults to `OnceNewDefaultVersionAvailable`.

---

A `model` block supports the following:

* `format` - (Required) The format of the Cognitive Services Account Deployment model. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Possible value is `OpenAI`.

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Cognitive Services Account Deployment model. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `version` - (Optional) The version of Cognitive Services Account Deployment model. If `version` is not specified, the default version of the model at the time will be assigned.

---

A `scale` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) The name of the SKU. Ex - `Standard` or `P3`. It is typically a letter+number code. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `tier` - (Optional) Possible values are `Free`, `Basic`, `Standard`, `Premium`, `Enterprise`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `size` - (Optional) The SKU size. When the name field is the combination of tier and some other value, this would be the standalone code. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `family` - (Optional) If the service has different generations of hardware, for the same SKU, then that can be captured here. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `capacity` - (Optional) Tokens-per-Minute (TPM). The unit of measure for this field is in the thousands of Tokens-per-Minute. Defaults to `1` which means that the limitation is `1000` tokens per minute. If the resources SKU supports scale in/out then the capacity field should be included in the resources' configuration. If the scale in/out is not supported by the resources SKU then this field can be safely omitted. For more information about TPM please see the [product documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/quota?tabs=rest).

* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Cognitive Services Account Deployment.
