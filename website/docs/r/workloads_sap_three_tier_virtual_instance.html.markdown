# azurerm_workloads_sap_three_tier_virtual_instance

Manages an SAP Three Tier Virtual Instance with a new SAP System.

-> **Note:** Before using this resource, it's required to submit the request of registering the Resource Provider with Azure CLI `az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.Workloads"`. The Resource Provider can take a while to register, you can check the status by running `az provider show --namespace "Microsoft.Workloads" --query "registrationState"`. Once this outputs "Registered" the Resource Provider is available for use.

## Example Usage

~> **Note:** While creating an SAP Three Tier Virtual Instance, the service will provision the extra SAP systems/components in the `app_resource_group_name` that are not defined in the HCL Configuration. At this time, if the `app_resource_group_name` is different from the Resource Group where SAP Three Tier Virtual Instance exists, you can set `prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources` to `false` to delete all resources defined in the HCL Configurations and the resources created in the `app_resource_group_name` with `terraform destroy`. However, if the `app_resource_group_name` is the same with the Resource Group where SAP Three Tier Virtual Instance exists, some resources, such as the subnet defined in the HCL Configuration, cannot be deleted with `terraform destroy` since the resources defined in the HCL Configuration are being referenced by the SAP system/component.

* `transport_create_and_mount` - (Optional) A `transport_create_and_mount` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **Note:** The file share configuration uses `skip` by default when `transport_create_and_mount` isn't set.

~> **Note:** Due to [a bug in the Azure API](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/issues/25209) where the Storage File Share Id is not defined correctly, it is not currently possible to support using Transport Mount.
