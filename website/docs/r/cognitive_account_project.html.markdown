# azurerm_cognitive_account_project

Manages a Cognitive Account Project.

~> **Note:** Cognitive Account Projects can only be created under a Cognitive Account that has `project_management_enabled = true`, `kind = "AIServices"`, a managed identity configured, and a `custom_subdomain_name` specified.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_cognitive_account" "example" {
  name                       = "example-account"
  location                   = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name        = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  kind                       = "AIServices"
  sku_name                   = "S0"
  project_management_enabled = true
  custom_subdomain_name      = "example-account-subdomain"

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_cognitive_account_project" "example" {
  name                 = "example-project"
  cognitive_account_id = azurerm_cognitive_account.example.id
  location             = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  description          = "Example cognitive services project"
  display_name         = "Example Project"

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "test"
  }
}
```
