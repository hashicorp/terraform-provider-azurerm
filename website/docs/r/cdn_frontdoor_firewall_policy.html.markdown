## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the policy. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sku_name` - (Required) The sku's pricing tier for this Front Door Firewall Policy. Possible values include `Standard_AzureFrontDoor` or `Premium_AzureFrontDoor`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** The `Standard_AzureFrontDoor` Front Door Firewall Policy sku may contain `custom` rules only. The `Premium_AzureFrontDoor` Front Door Firewall Policy skus may contain both `custom` and `managed` rules.

* `enabled` - (Optional) Is the Front Door Firewall Policy enabled? Defaults to `true`.

* `mode` - (Required) The Front Door Firewall Policy mode. Possible values are `Detection`, `Prevention`.

* `request_body_check_enabled` - (Optional) Should policy managed rules inspect the request body content? Defaults to `true`.

-> **NOTE:** When run in `Detection` mode, the Front Door Firewall Policy doesn't take any other actions other than monitoring and logging the request and its matched Front Door Rule to the Web Application Firewall logs.

* `redirect_url` - (Optional) If action type is redirect, this field represents redirect URL for the client.

* `custom_rule` - (Optional) One or more `custom_rule` blocks as defined below.

* `custom_block_response_status_code` - (Optional) If a `custom_rule` block's action type is `block`, this is the response status code. Possible values are `200`, `403`, `405`, `406`, or `429`.

* `custom_block_response_body` - (Optional) If a `custom_rule` block's action type is `block`, this is the response body. The body must be specified in base64 encoding.

* `managed_rule` - (Optional) One or more `managed_rule` blocks as defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the Front Door Firewall Policy.

* `priority` - (Optional) The priority of the rule. Rules with a lower value will be evaluated before rules with a higher value. Defaults to `1`.

* `type` - (Required) The type of rule. Possible values are `MatchRule` or `RateLimitRule`.

* `match_condition` - (Optional) One or more `match_condition` block defined below. Can support up to `10` `match_condition` blocks.

* `rate_limit_duration_in_minutes` - (Optional) The rate limit duration in minutes. Defaults to `1`.

* `rate_limit_threshold` - (Optional) The rate limit threshold. Defaults to `10`.

---

A `match_condition` block supports the following:

* `match_variable` - (Required) The request variable to compare with. Possible values are `Cookies`, `PostArgs`, `QueryString`, `RemoteAddr`, `RequestBody`, `RequestHeader`, `RequestMethod`, `RequestUri`, or `SocketAddr`.

* `match_values` - (Required) Up to `600` possible values to match. Limit is in total across all `match_condition` blocks and `match_values` arguments. String value itself can be up to `256` characters in length.

* `selector` - (Optional) Match against a specific key if the `match_variable` is `QueryString`, `PostArgs`, `RequestHeader` or `Cookies`.
