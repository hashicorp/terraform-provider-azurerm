# azurerm_frontdoor_firewall_policy

!> **IMPORTANT** This deploys an Azure Front Door (classic) resource which has been deprecated and will receive security updates only. Please migrate your existing Azure Front Door (classic) deployments to the new [Azure Front Door (standard/premium) resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/cdn_frontdoor_custom_domain). For your convenience, the service team has exposed a `Front Door Classic` to `Front Door Standard/Premium` [migration tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/frontdoor/tier-migration) to allow you to migrate your existing `Front Door Classic` instances to the new `Front Door Standard/Premium` product tiers.

Manages an Azure Front Door (classic) Web Application Firewall Policy instance.

!> **Be Aware:** Azure is rolling out a breaking change on Friday 9th April 2021 which may cause issues with the CDN/FrontDoor resources. [More information is available in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/11231) - however unfortunately this may necessitate a breaking change to the CDN and Front Door resources, more information will be posted [in the GitHub issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/11231) as the necessary changes are identified.
