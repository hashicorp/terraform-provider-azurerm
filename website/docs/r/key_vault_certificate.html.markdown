# azurerm_key_vault_certificate

Manages a Key Vault Certificate.

~> **Note:** The Azure Provider includes a Feature Toggle which will purge a Key Vault Certificate resource on destroy, rather than the default soft-delete. See [`purge_soft_deleted_certificates_on_destroy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/features-block#purge_soft_deleted_certificates_on_destroy) for more information. 

## Example Usage (Importing a PFX)

~> **Note:** this example assumed the PFX file is located in the same directory at `certificate-to-import.pfx`.

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {
    key_vault {
      purge_soft_deleted_certificates_on_destroy = true
      recover_soft_deleted_certificates          = true
    }
  }
}

  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

  name                = "examplekeyvault"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  tenant_id           = data.azurerm_client_config.current.tenant_id
  sku_name            = "premium"

  access_policy {
    tenant_id = data.azurerm_client_config.current.tenant_id
    object_id = data.azurerm_client_config.current.object_id

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Key Vault Certificate. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `key_vault_id` - (Required) The ID of the Key Vault where the Certificate should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `certificate` - (Optional) A `certificate` block as defined below, used to Import an existing certificate. Changing this will create a new version of the Key Vault Certificate.

* `certificate_policy` - (Optional) A `certificate_policy` block as defined below. Changing this (except the `lifetime_action` field) will create a new version of the Key Vault Certificate.

~> **NOTE:** When creating a Key Vault Certificate, at least one of `certificate` or `certificate_policy` is required. Provide `certificate` to import an existing certificate, `certificate_policy` to generate a new certificate.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

The `certificate` block supports the following:

* `contents` - (Required) The base64-encoded certificate contents.
* `password` - (Optional) The password associated with the certificate.

~> **NOTE:** A PEM certificate is already base64 encoded. To successfully import, the `contents` property should include a PEM encoded X509 certificate and a private_key in pkcs8 format. There should only be linux style `\n` line endings and the whole block should have the PEM begin/end blocks around the certificate data and the private key data.

To convert a private key to pkcs8 format with openssl use:
```shell
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in private_key.pem > private_key_pk8.pem
```

The PEM content should look something like:
```text
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
aGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8K
:
aGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8KaGVsbG8K
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
d29ybGQKd29ybGQKd29ybGQKd29ybGQKd29ybGQKd29ybGQKd29ybGQKd29ybGQK

---

The `issuer_parameters` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Certificate Issuer. Possible values include `Self` (for self-signed certificate), or `Unknown` (for a certificate issuing authority like `Let's Encrypt` and Azure direct supported ones).

---

The `key_properties` block supports the following:

* `curve` - (Optional) Specifies the curve to use when creating an `EC` key. Possible values are `P-256`, `P-256K`, `P-384`, and `P-521`. This field will be required in a future release if `key_type` is `EC` or `EC-HSM`.
* `exportable` - (Required) Is this certificate exportable?
* `key_size` - (Optional) The size of the key used in the certificate. Possible values include `2048`, `3072`, and `4096` for `RSA` keys, or `256`, `384`, and `521` for `EC` keys. This property is required when using RSA keys.
* `key_type` - (Required) Specifies the type of key. Possible values are `EC`, `EC-HSM`, `RSA`, `RSA-HSM` and `oct`.
* `reuse_key` - (Required) Is the key reusable?

---

The `lifetime_action` block supports the following:

* `trigger` - (Required) A `trigger` block as defined below.

---

The `action` block supports the following:

---

The `trigger` block supports the following:

* `days_before_expiry` - (Optional) The number of days before the Certificate expires that the action associated with this Trigger should run. Conflicts with `lifetime_percentage`.
* `lifetime_percentage` - (Optional) The percentage at which during the Certificates Lifetime the action associated with this Trigger should run. Conflicts with `days_before_expiry`.

---

The `secret_properties` block supports the following:

* `content_type` - (Required) The Content-Type of the Certificate, such as `application/x-pkcs12` for a PFX or `application/x-pem-file` for a PEM.

* `extended_key_usage` - (Optional) A list of Extended/Enhanced Key Usages.
* `key_usage` - (Required) A list of uses associated with this Key. Possible values include `cRLSign`, `dataEncipherment`, `decipherOnly`, `digitalSignature`, `encipherOnly`, `keyAgreement`, `keyCertSign`, `keyEncipherment` and `nonRepudiation` and are case-sensitive.
* `subject` - (Required) The Certificate's Subject.
* `subject_alternative_names` - (Optional) A `subject_alternative_names` block as defined below.
* `validity_in_months` - (Required) The Certificates Validity Period in Months.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Key Vault Certificate ID.
* `secret_id` - The ID of the associated Key Vault Secret.
* `version` - The current version of the Key Vault Certificate.
* `versionless_id` - The Base ID of the Key Vault Certificate.
* `versionless_secret_id` - The Base ID of the Key Vault Secret.
* `certificate_data` - The raw Key Vault Certificate data represented as a hexadecimal string.
* `certificate_data_base64` - The Base64 encoded Key Vault Certificate data.
* `thumbprint` - The X509 Thumbprint of the Key Vault Certificate represented as a hexadecimal string.
* `certificate_attribute` - A `certificate_attribute` block as defined below.
 
* `resource_manager_id` - The (Versioned) ID for this Key Vault Certificate. This property points to a specific version of a Key Vault Certificate, as such using this won't auto-rotate values if used in other Azure Services.

* `resource_manager_versionless_id` - The Versionless ID of the Key Vault Certificate. This property allows other Azure Services (that support it) to auto-rotate their value when the Key Vault Certificate is updated.

---

A `certificate_attribute` block exports the following:

* `created` - The create time of the Key Vault Certificate.
* `enabled` - whether the Key Vault Certificate is enabled.
* `expires` - The expires time of the Key Vault Certificate.
* `not_before` - The not before valid time of the Key Vault Certificate.
* `recovery_level` - The deletion recovery level of the Key Vault Certificate.
* `updated` - The recent update time of the Key Vault Certificate.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 60 minutes) Used when creating the Key Vault Certificate.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Key Vault Certificate.
* `read` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when retrieving the Key Vault Certificate.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Key Vault Certificate.

## Import

Key Vault Certificates can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_key_vault_certificate.example "https://example-keyvault.vault.azure.net/certificates/example/fdf067c93bbb4b22bff4d8b7a9a56217"
```
