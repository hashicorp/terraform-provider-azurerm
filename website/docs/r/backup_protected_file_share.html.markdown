# azurerm_backup_protected_file_share

Manages an Azure Backup Protected File Share to enable backups for file shares within an Azure Storage Account

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "tfex-recovery_vault"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_recovery_services_vault" "vault" {
  name                = "tfex-recovery-vault"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  sku                 = "Standard"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "sa" {
  name                     = "examplesa"
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_share" "example" {
  name                 = "example-share"
  storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.sa.name
  quota                = 1
}

resource "azurerm_backup_container_storage_account" "protection-container" {
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  recovery_vault_name = azurerm_recovery_services_vault.vault.name
  storage_account_id  = azurerm_storage_account.sa.id
}

resource "azurerm_backup_policy_file_share" "example" {
  name                = "tfex-recovery-vault-policy"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  recovery_vault_name = azurerm_recovery_services_vault.vault.name

  backup {
    frequency = "Daily"
    time      = "23:00"
  }

  retention_daily {
    count = 10
  }
}

resource "azurerm_backup_protected_file_share" "share1" {
  resource_group_name       = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  recovery_vault_name       = azurerm_recovery_services_vault.vault.name
  source_storage_account_id = azurerm_backup_container_storage_account.protection-container.storage_account_id
  source_file_share_name    = azurerm_storage_share.example.name
  backup_policy_id          = azurerm_backup_policy_file_share.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Azure Backup Protected File Share. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `recovery_vault_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Recovery Services Vault to use. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_storage_account_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the storage account of the file share to backup. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **Note:** The storage account must already be registered with the recovery vault in order to backup shares within the account. You can use the `azurerm_backup_container_storage_account` resource or the [Register-AzRecoveryServicesBackupContainer PowerShell cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/az.recoveryservices/register-azrecoveryservicesbackupcontainer?view=azps-3.2.0) to register a storage account with a vault. When using the `azurerm_backup_container_storage_account` resource to register, you can use `depends_on` to explicitly declare the dependency. It will make sure that the registration is completed before creating the `azurerm_backup_protected_file_share` resource.

* `source_file_share_name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the file share to backup. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `backup_policy_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the backup policy to use. The policy must be an Azure File Share backup policy. Other types are not supported.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Backup File Share.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 80 minutes) Used when creating the Backup File Share.
* `update` - (Defaults to 80 minutes) Used when updating the Backup File Share.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Backup File Share.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 80 minutes) Used when deleting the Backup File Share.

## Import

Azure Backup Protected File Shares can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_backup_protected_file_share.item1 "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/example-recovery-vault/backupFabrics/Azure/protectionContainers/StorageContainer;storage;group2;example-storage-account/protectedItems/AzureFileShare;3f6e3108a45793581bcbd1c61c87a3b2ceeb4ff4bc02a95ce9d1022b23722935"
```

-> **Note:** The ID requires quoting as there are semicolons. This user unfriendly ID can be found in the Deployments of the used resourcegroup, look for an Deployment which starts with `ConfigureAFSProtection-`, click then `Go to resource`.
