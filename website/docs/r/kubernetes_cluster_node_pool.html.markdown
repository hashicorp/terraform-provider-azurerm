# azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool

Manages a Node Pool within a Kubernetes Cluster

-> **Note:** Due to the fast-moving nature of AKS, we recommend using the latest version of the Azure Provider when using AKS - you can find [the latest version of the Azure Provider here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest).

~> **NOTE:** Multiple Node Pools are only supported when the Kubernetes Cluster is using Virtual Machine Scale Sets.

## Example Usage

This example provisions a basic Kubernetes Node Pool. Other examples of the `azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool` resource can be found in [the `./examples/kubernetes` directory within the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples/kubernetes)

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name                = "example-aks1"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  dns_prefix          = "exampleaks1"

  default_node_pool {
    name       = "default"
    node_count = 1
    vm_size    = "Standard_D2_v2"
  }

  service_principal {
    client_id     = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    client_secret = "00000000000000000000000000000000"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster_node_pool" "example" {
  name                  = "internal"
  kubernetes_cluster_id = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.example.id
  vm_size               = "Standard_DS2_v2"
  node_count            = 1

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}
```
