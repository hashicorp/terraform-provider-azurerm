# azurerm_stack_hci_deployment_setting

Manages a Stack HCI Deployment Setting.

-> Note: Completion of the prerequisites of deploying the Azure Stack HCI in your environment is outside the scope of this document. For more details refer to the [Azure Stack HCI deployment sequence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-stack/hci/deploy/deployment-introduction#deployment-sequence). If you encounter issues completing the prerequisites, we'd recommend opening a ticket with Microsoft Support.

-> Note: During the deployment process, the service will generate additional resources, including a new Arc Bridge Appliance and a Custom Location containing several Stack HCI Storage Paths. The provider will attempt to remove these resources on the deletion or recreation of `azurerm_stack_hci_deployment_setting`.

* `bitlocker_boot_volume_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable BitLocker for boot volume. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, BitLocker XTS_AES 256-bit encryption is enabled for all data-at-rest on the OS volume of your Azure Stack HCI cluster. This setting is TPM-hardware dependent. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `bitlocker_data_volume_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable BitLocker for data volume. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, BitLocker XTS-AES 256-bit encryption is enabled for all data-at-rest on your Azure Stack HCI cluster shared volumes. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `credential_guard_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable credential guard. Possible values are `true` and `false`. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `drift_control_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable drift control. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, the security baseline is re-applied regularly. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `drtm_protection_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable DRTM protection. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, Secure Boot is enabled on your Azure HCI cluster. This setting is hardware dependent. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `hvci_protection_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable HVCI protection. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity is enabled on your Azure HCI cluster. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `side_channel_mitigation_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable side channel mitigation. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, all side channel mitigations are enabled on your Azure HCI cluster. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `smb_cluster_encryption_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable SMB cluster encryption. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, cluster east-west traffic is encrypted. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `smb_signing_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable SMB signing. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, the SMB default instance requires sign in for the client and server services. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `wdac_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable WDAC. Possible values are `true` and `false`. When set to `true`, applications and the code that you can run on your Azure Stack HCI cluster are limited. Defaults to `true`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

A `storage` block supports the following:

* `configuration_mode` - (Required) The configuration mode of storage. If set to `Express` and your storage is configured as per best practices based on the number of nodes in the cluster. Possible values are `Express`, `InfraOnly` and `KeepStorage`. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

---

A `storage_network` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the storage network. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `network_adapter_name` - (Required) The name of the network adapter. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `vlan_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID for the VLAN storage network. This setting is applied to the network interfaces that route the storage and VM migration traffic. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

---

A `virtual_switch_configuration_override` block supports the following:

* `enable_iov` - (Optional) Specifies the IoV enable status for Virtual Switch. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

* `load_balancing_algorithm` - (Optional) Specifies the load balancing algorithm for Virtual Switch. Changing this forces a new Stack HCI Deployment Setting to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported: 

* `id` - The ID of the Stack HCI Deployment Setting.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 6 hours) Used when creating the Stack HCI Deployment Setting.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Stack HCI Deployment Setting.
