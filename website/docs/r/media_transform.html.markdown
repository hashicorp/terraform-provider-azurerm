# azurerm_media_transform

Manages a Transform.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "media-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestoracc"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "GRS"
}

resource "azurerm_media_services_account" "example" {
  name                = "examplemediaacc"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  storage_account {
    id         = azurerm_storage_account.example.id
    is_primary = true
  }
}

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `media_services_account_name` - (Required) The Media Services account name. Changing this forces a new Transform to be created.

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Transform. Changing this forces a new Transform to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Transform should exist. Changing this forces a new Transform to be created.

---

* `description` - (Optional) An optional verbose description of the Transform.

* `output` - (Optional) One or more `output` blocks as defined below. At least one `output` must be defined.

---

A `aac_audio` block supports the following:

* `bitrate` - (Optional) The bitrate of the audio in bits per second. Default to `128000`.

* `channels` - (Optional) The number of audio channels. Default to `2`.

* `label` - (Optional) Specifies the label for the codec. The label can be used to control muxing behavior.

* `profile` - (Optional) The encoding profile to be used when encoding audio with AAC. Possible values are `AacLc`, `HeAacV1`,and `HeAacV2`. Default to `AacLc`.

* `sampling_rate` - (Optional) The sampling rate to use for encoding in Hertz. Default to `48000`.

---

A `audio_analyzer_preset` block supports the following:

* `audio_language` - (Optional) The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47 format of 'language tag-region' (e.g: 'en-US'). If you know the language of your content, it is recommended that you specify it. The language must be specified explicitly for AudioAnalysisMode:Basic, since automatic language detection is not included in basic mode. If the language isn't specified, automatic language detection will choose the first language detected and process with the selected language for the duration of the file. It does not currently support dynamically switching between languages after the first language is detected. The automatic detection works best with audio recordings with clearly discernible speech. If automatic detection fails to find the language, transcription would fall back to `en-US`. The list of supported languages is available here: <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109463>.

* `audio_analysis_mode` - (Optional) Possible values are `Basic` or `Standard`. Determines the set of audio analysis operations to be performed. Default to `Standard`.

* `experimental_options` - (Optional) Dictionary containing key value pairs for parameters not exposed in the preset itself.

---

An `audio` block supports the following:

* `input_label` - (Required) The label of the job input which is to be used as an overlay. The input must specify exact one file. You can specify an image file in JPG, PNG, GIF or BMP format, or an audio file (such as a WAV, MP3, WMA or M4A file), or a video file.

* `audio_gain_level` - (Optional) The gain level of audio in the overlay. The value should be in the range `0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0`.

* `end` - (Optional) The end position, with reference to the input video, at which the overlay ends. The value should be in ISO 8601 format. For example, `PT30S` to end the overlay at 30 seconds into the input video. If not specified or the value is greater than the input video duration, the overlay will be applied until the end of the input video if the overlay media duration is greater than the input video duration, else the overlay will last as long as the overlay media duration.

* `fade_in_duration` - (Optional) The duration over which the overlay fades in onto the input video. The value should be in ISO 8601 duration format. If not specified the default behavior is to have no fade in (same as `PT0S`).

* `fade_out_duration` - (Optional) The duration over which the overlay fades out of the input video. The value should be in ISO 8601 duration format. If not specified the default behavior is to have no fade out (same as `PT0S`).

* `start` - (Optional) The start position, with reference to the input video, at which the overlay starts. The value should be in ISO 8601 format. For example, `PT05S` to start the overlay at 5 seconds into the input video. If not specified the overlay starts from the beginning of the input video.

---

A `builtin_preset` block supports the following:

* `preset_name` - (Required) The built-in preset to be used for encoding videos. The Possible values are `AACGoodQualityAudio`, `AdaptiveStreaming`, `ContentAwareEncoding`, `ContentAwareEncodingExperimental`, `CopyAllBitrateNonInterleaved`, `DDGoodQualityAudio`, `H265AdaptiveStreaming`, `H265ContentAwareEncoding`, `H265SingleBitrate4K`, `H265SingleBitrate1080p`, `H265SingleBitrate720p`, `H264MultipleBitrate1080p`, `H264MultipleBitrateSD`, `H264MultipleBitrate720p`, `H264SingleBitrate1080p`, `H264SingleBitrateSD` and `H264SingleBitrate720p`.

* `preset_configuration` - (Optional) A `preset_configuration` block as defined below.

---

A `codec` block supports the following:

* `aac_audio` - (Optional) A `aac_audio` block as defined above.
 
* `copy_audio` - (Optional) A `copy_audio` block as defined below.

* `copy_video` - (Optional) A `copy_video` block as defined below.

* `dd_audio` - (Optional) A `dd_audio` block as defined below.

* `h264_video` - (Optional) A `h264_video` block as defined below.

* `h265_video` - (Optional) A `h265_video` block as defined below.

* `jpg_image` - (Optional) A `jpg_image` block as defined below.

* `png_image` - (Optional) A `png_image` block as defined below.

-> **NOTE:** Each codec can only have one type: `aac_audio`, `copy_audio`, `copy_video`, `dd_audio`, `h264_video`, `h265_video`, `jpg_image` or `png_image`. If you need to apply different codec you must create one codec for each one.

---

A `copy_audio` block supports the following:

* `label` - (Optional) Specifies the label for the codec. The label can be used to control muxing behavior. 

---

The number of rows are automatically calculated and a VTT file is generated with the coordinate mappings for each thumbnail in the sprite. Note: this value should be a positive integer and a proper value is recommended so that the output image resolution will not go beyond JPEG maximum pixel resolution limit `65535x65535`.

* `step` - (Optional) The intervals at which thumbnails are generated. The value can be in ISO 8601 format (For example, `PT05S` for one image every 5 seconds), or a frame count (For example, `30` for one image every 30 frames), or a relative value to stream duration (For example, `10%` for one image every 10% of stream duration).

If the length of base name of the input video file exceeds 32 characters, the base name is truncated to the first 32 characters in total length. `{Extension}` - The appropriate extension for this format. `{Label}` - The label assigned to the codec/layer. `{Index}` - A unique index for thumbnails. Only applicable to thumbnails. `{AudioStream}` - string "Audio" plus audio stream number(start from 1). `{Bitrate}` - The audio/video bitrate in kbps. Not applicable to thumbnails. `{Codec}` - The type of the audio/video codec. `{Resolution}` - The video resolution. Any unsubstituted macros will be collapsed and removed from the filename.

* `output_file` - (Optional) One or more `output_file` blocks as defined above.

---

An `video` block supports the following:

* `input_label` - (Required) The label of the job input which is to be used as an overlay. The input must specify exact one file. You can specify an image file in JPG, PNG, GIF or BMP format, or an audio file (such as a WAV, MP3, WMA or M4A file), or a video file.

* `audio_gain_level` - (Optional) The gain level of audio in the overlay. The value should be in range between `0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0`.

* `crop_rectangle` - (Optional) A `crop_rectangle` block as defined above.

* `end` - (Optional) The end position, with reference to the input video, at which the overlay ends. The value should be in ISO 8601 format. For example, `PT30S` to end the overlay at 30 seconds into the input video. If not specified or the value is greater than the input video duration, the overlay will be applied until the end of the input video if the overlay media duration is greater than the input video duration, else the overlay will last as long as the overlay media duration.

* `fade_in_duration` - (Optional) The duration over which the overlay fades in onto the input video. The value should be in ISO 8601 duration format. If not specified the default behavior is to have no fade in (same as `PT0S`).

* `fade_out_duration` - (Optional) The duration over which the overlay fades out of the input video. The value should be in ISO 8601 duration format. If not specified the default behavior is to have no fade out (same as `PT0S`).

* `opacity` - (Optional) The opacity of the overlay. The value should be in the range between `0` to `1.0`. Default to `1.0`, which means the overlay is opaque.

* `position` - (Optional) A `position` block as defined above.

* `start` - (Optional) The start position, with reference to the input video, at which the overlay starts. The value should be in ISO 8601 format. For example, `PT05S` to start the overlay at 5 seconds into the input video. If not specified the overlay starts from the beginning of the input video.

A `video_analyzer_preset` block supports the following:

* `audio_language` - (Optional) The language for the audio payload in the input using the BCP-47 format of 'language tag-region' (e.g: 'en-US'). If you know the language of your content, it is recommended that you specify it. The language must be specified explicitly for AudioAnalysisMode:Basic, since automatic language detection is not included in basic mode. If the language isn't specified, automatic language detection will choose the first language detected and process with the selected language for the duration of the file. It does not currently support dynamically switching between languages after the first language is detected. The automatic detection works best with audio recordings with clearly discernible speech. If automatic detection fails to find the language, transcription would fall back to `en-US`. The list of supported languages is available here: <https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109463>. 

* `audio_analysis_mode` - (Optional) Possible values are `Basic` or `Standard`. Determines the set of audio analysis operations to be performed. Default to `Standard`.

* `experimental_options` - (Optional) Dictionary containing key value pairs for parameters not exposed in the preset itself.
 
* `insights_type` - (Optional) Defines the type of insights that you want the service to generate. The allowed values are `AudioInsightsOnly`, `VideoInsightsOnly`, and `AllInsights`. If you set this to `AllInsights` and the input is audio only, then only audio insights are generated. Similarly, if the input is video only, then only video insights are generated. It is recommended that you not use `AudioInsightsOnly` if you expect some of your inputs to be video only; or use `VideoInsightsOnly` if you expect some of your inputs to be audio only. Your Jobs in such conditions would error out. Default to `AllInsights`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Transform.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Transform.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Transform.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Transform.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Transform.

## Import

Transforms can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_media_transform.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.Media/mediaServices/media1/transforms/transform1
