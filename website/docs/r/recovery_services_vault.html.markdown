Manages a Recovery Services Vault.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "tfex-recovery_vault"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_recovery_services_vault" "vault" {
  name                = "example-recovery-vault"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  sku                 = "Standard"

  soft_delete_enabled = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Recovery Services Vault. Recovery Service Vault name must be 2 - 50 characters long, start with a letter, contain only letters, numbers and hyphens. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Recovery Services Vault. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `sku` - (Required) Sets the vault's SKU. Possible values include: `Standard`, `RS0`.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - (Optional) Is it enabled to access the vault from public networks. Defaults to `true`.

* `immutability` - (Optional) Immutability Settings of vault, possible values include: `Locked`, `Unlocked` and `Disabled`.

-> **Note:** Once `immutability` is set to `Locked`, changing it to other values forces a new Recovery Services Vault to be created.

* `storage_mode_type` - (Optional) The storage type of the Recovery Services Vault. Possible values are `GeoRedundant`, `LocallyRedundant` and `ZoneRedundant`. Defaults to `GeoRedundant`.

* `cross_region_restore_enabled` - (Optional) Is cross region restore enabled for this Vault? Only can be `true`, when `storage_mode_type` is `GeoRedundant`. Defaults to `false`.

-> **Note:** Once `cross_region_restore_enabled` is set to `true`, changing it back to `false` forces a new Recovery Service Vault to be created.

* `soft_delete_enabled` - (Optional) Is soft delete enable for this Vault? Defaults to `true`.

* `encryption` - (Optional) An `encryption` block as defined below. Required with `identity`.

!> **Note:** Once Encryption with your own key has been Enabled it's not possible to Disable it.

* `classic_vmware_replication_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to enable the Classic experience for VMware replication. If set to `false` VMware machines will be protected using the new stateless ASR replication appliance. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `monitoring` - (Optional) A `monitoring` block as defined below.
