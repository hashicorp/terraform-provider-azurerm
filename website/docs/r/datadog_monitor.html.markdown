}
resource "azurerm_datadog_monitor" "example" {
  name                = "example-monitor"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  datadog_organization {
    api_key         = "XXXX"
    application_key = "XXXX"
  }
  user {
    name  = "Example"
    email = "abc@xyz.com"

    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }
}
```

* `api_key` - (Required) Api key associated to the Datadog organization. Changing this forces a new Datadog Monitor to be created.

* `application_key` - (Required) Application key associated to the Datadog organization. Changing this forces a new Datadog Monitor to be created.

* `enterprise_app_id` - (Optional) The ID of the enterprise_app. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `linking_auth_code` - (Optional) The auth code used to linking to an existing Datadog organization. Changing this forces a new Datadog Monitor to be created.

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the identity type of the Datadog Monitor. At this time the only allowed value is `SystemAssigned`.

> **NOTE:** The assigned `principal_id` and `tenant_id` can be retrieved after the identity `type` has been set to `SystemAssigned` and the Datadog Monitor has been created. More details are available below.

---

An `user` block exports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this user_info. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `email` - (Required) Email of the user used by Datadog for contacting them if needed. Changing this forces a new Datadog Monitor to be created.

### Role assignment on the monitor created

```hcl
data "azurerm_subscription" "primary" {}

data "azurerm_role_definition" "monitoring_reader" {
  name = "Monitoring Reader"
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example" {
  scope              = data.azurerm_subscription.primary.id
  role_definition_id = data.azurerm_role_definition.monitoring_reader.role_definition_id
  principal_id       = azurerm_datadog_monitor.example.identity[0].principal_id
}
```
