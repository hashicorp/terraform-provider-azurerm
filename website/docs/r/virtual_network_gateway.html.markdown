## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `ip_configuration` - (Required) One or more (up to 3) `ip_configuration` blocks documented below.
  An active-standby gateway requires exactly one `ip_configuration` block,
  an active-active gateway requires exactly two `ip_configuration` blocks whereas
  an active-active zone redundant gateway with P2S configuration requires exactly three `ip_configuration` blocks.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the Virtual Network Gateway is located. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `name` - (Required) The name of the Virtual Network Gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Virtual Network Gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sku` - (Required) Configuration of the size and capacity of the virtual network gateway. Valid options are `Basic`, `Standard`, `HighPerformance`, `UltraPerformance`, `ErGw1AZ`, `ErGw2AZ`, `ErGw3AZ`, `VpnGw1`, `VpnGw2`, `VpnGw3`, `VpnGw4`,`VpnGw5`, `VpnGw1AZ`, `VpnGw2AZ`, `VpnGw3AZ`,`VpnGw4AZ` and `VpnGw5AZ` and depend on the `type`, `vpn_type` and `generation` arguments. A `PolicyBased` gateway only supports the `Basic` SKU. Further, the `UltraPerformance` SKU is only supported by an `ExpressRoute` gateway.

~> **NOTE:** To build a UltraPerformance ExpressRoute Virtual Network gateway, the associated Public IP needs to be SKU "Basic" not "Standard"

~> **NOTE:** Not all SKUs (e.g. `ErGw1AZ`) are available in all regions. If you see `StatusCode=400 -- Original Error: Code="InvalidGatewaySkuSpecifiedForGatewayDeploymentType"` please try another region.

* `type` - (Required) The type of the Virtual Network Gateway. Valid options are `Vpn` or `ExpressRoute`. Changing the type forces a new resource to be created.

---

* `active_active` - (Optional) If `true`, an active-active Virtual Network Gateway will be created. An active-active gateway requires a `HighPerformance` or an `UltraPerformance` SKU. If `false`, an active-standby gateway will be created. Defaults to `false`.

* `default_local_network_gateway_id` - (Optional) The ID of the local network gateway through which outbound Internet traffic from the virtual network in which the gateway is created will be routed (*forced tunnelling*). Refer to the [Azure documentation on forced tunnelling](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-forced-tunneling-rm). If not specified, forced tunnelling is disabled.

* `edge_zone` - (Optional) Specifies the Edge Zone within the Azure Region where this Virtual Network Gateway should exist. Changing this forces a new Virtual Network Gateway to be created.

* `enable_bgp` - (Optional) If `true`, BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) will be enabled for this Virtual Network Gateway. Defaults to `false`.

* `bgp_settings` - (Optional) A `bgp_settings` block which is documented below. In this block the BGP specific settings can be defined.

* `custom_route` - (Optional) A `custom_route` block as defined below. Specifies a custom routes address space for a virtual network gateway and a VpnClient.

* `generation` - (Optional) The Generation of the Virtual Network gateway. Possible values include `Generation1`, `Generation2` or `None`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** The available values depend on the `type` and `sku` arguments - where `Generation2` is only value for a `sku` larger than `VpnGw2` or `VpnGw2AZ`.

* `private_ip_address_enabled` - (Optional) Should private IP be enabled on this gateway for connections? Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `bgp_route_translation_for_nat_enabled` - (Optional) Is BGP Route Translation for NAT enabled? Defaults to `false`.

* `dns_forwarding_enabled` - (Optional) Is DNS forwarding enabled?

* `ip_sec_replay_protection_enabled` - (Optional) Is IP Sec Replay Protection enabled? Defaults to `true`.
