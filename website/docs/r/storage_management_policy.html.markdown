## Import

Storage Account Management Policies can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_storage_management_policy.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/myaccountname/managementPolicies/default
