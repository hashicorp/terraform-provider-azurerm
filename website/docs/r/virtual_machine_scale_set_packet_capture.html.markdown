~> **NOTE:** This Resource requires that [the Network Watcher Extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/network-watcher/network-watcher-packet-capture-manage-portal#before-you-begin) is installed on the Virtual Machine Scale Set before capturing can be enabled which can be installed via [the `azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set_extension` resource](virtual_machine_scale_set_extension.html).

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name to use for this Network Packet Capture. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `network_watcher_id` - (Required) The resource ID of the Network Watcher. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `virtual_machine_scale_set_id` - (Required) The resource ID of the Virtual Machine Scale Set to capture packets from. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `maximum_bytes_per_packet` - (Optional) The number of bytes captured per packet. The remaining bytes are truncated. Defaults to `0` (Entire Packet Captured). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `maximum_bytes_per_session` - (Optional) Maximum size of the capture in Bytes. Defaults to `1073741824` (1GB). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `maximum_capture_duration_in_seconds` - (Optional) The maximum duration of the capture session in seconds. Defaults to `18000` (5 hours). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `storage_location` - (Required) A `storage_location` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `filter` - (Optional) One or more `filter` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `machine_scope` - (Optional) A `machine_scope` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

A `storage_location` block contains:

* `file_path` - (Optional) A valid local path on the targeting VM. Must include the name of the capture file (*.cap). For Linux virtual machine it must start with `/var/captures`.

* `storage_account_id` - (Optional) The ID of the storage account to save the packet capture session

~> **NOTE:** At least one of `file_path` or `storage_account_id` must be specified.

---

A `filter` block contains:

* `local_ip_address` - (Optional) The local IP Address to be filtered on. Specify `127.0.0.1` for a single address entry, `127.0.0.1-127.0.0.255` for a range and `127.0.0.1;127.0.0.5` for multiple entries. Multiple ranges and mixing ranges with multiple entries are currently not supported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `local_port` - (Optional) The local port to be filtered on. Specify `80` for single port entry, `80-85` for a range and `80;443;` for multiple entries. Multiple ranges and mixing ranges with multiple entries are currently not supported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `protocol` - (Required) The Protocol to be filtered on. Possible values include `Any`, `TCP` and `UDP`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `remote_ip_address` - (Optional) The remote IP Address to be filtered on. Specify `127.0.0.1` for a single address entry, `127.0.0.1-127.0.0.255` for a range and `127.0.0.1;127.0.0.5` for multiple entries. Multiple ranges and mixing ranges with multiple entries are currently not supported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `remote_port` - (Optional) The remote port to be filtered on. Specify `80` for single port entry, `80-85` for a range and `80;443;` for multiple entries. Multiple ranges and mixing ranges with multiple entries are currently not supported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

A `machine_scope` block contains:

* `exclude_instance_ids` - (Optional) A list of Virtual Machine Scale Set instance IDs which should be excluded from running Packet Capture, e.g. `["0", "2"]`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `include_instance_ids` - (Optional) A list of Virtual Machine Scale Set instance IDs which should be included for Packet Capture, e.g. `["1", "3"]`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Virtual Machine Scale Set Packet Capture ID.

* `storage_location` - (Required) A `storage_location` block as defined below.

---

A `storage_location` block contains:

* `storage_path` - The URI of the storage path where the packet capture sessions are saved to.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Virtual Machine Scale Set Packet Capture.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Virtual Machine Scale Set Packet Capture.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Virtual Machine Scale Set Packet Capture.

## Import

Virtual Machine Scale Set Packet Captures can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set_packet_capture.capture1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/watcher1/packetCaptures/capture1
```
