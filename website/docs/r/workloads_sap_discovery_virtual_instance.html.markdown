# azurerm_workloads_sap_discovery_virtual_instance

Manages an SAP Discovery Virtual Instance.

-> **Note:** Before using this resource, it's required to submit the request of registering the Resource Provider with Azure CLI `az provider register --namespace "Microsoft.Workloads"`. The Resource Provider can take a while to register, you can check the status by running `az provider show --namespace "Microsoft.Workloads" --query "registrationState"`. Once this outputs "Registered" the Resource Provider is available for use.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-sapvis"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_workloads_sap_discovery_virtual_instance" "example" {
  name                              = "X01"
  resource_group_name               = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                          = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  environment                       = "NonProd"
  sap_product                       = "S4HANA"
  central_server_virtual_machine_id = "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/exampleRG/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/csvm1"
  managed_storage_account_name      = "managedsa"

  identity {
    type = "UserAssigned"

    identity_ids = [
      "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/exampleRG/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/uai1"
    ]
  }

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [managed_resource_group_name]
  }
}
```
