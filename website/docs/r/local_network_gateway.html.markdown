  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_local_network_gateway" "home" {
  name                = "backHome"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  gateway_address     = "12.13.14.15"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the local network gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the local network gateway. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The location/region where the local network gateway is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `address_space` - (Optional) The list of string CIDRs representing the address spaces the gateway exposes.

* `bgp_settings` - (Optional) A `bgp_settings` block as defined below containing the Local Network Gateway's BGP speaker settings.

* `gateway_address` - (Optional) The gateway IP address to connect with.

* `gateway_fqdn` - (Optional) The gateway FQDN to connect with.
