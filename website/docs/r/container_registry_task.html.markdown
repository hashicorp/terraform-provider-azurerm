  location = "West Europe"
}
resource "azurerm_container_registry" "example" {
  name                = "example"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  sku                 = "Basic"
}
resource "azurerm_container_registry_task" "example" {
  name                  = "example-task"
  container_registry_id = azurerm_container_registry.example.id
