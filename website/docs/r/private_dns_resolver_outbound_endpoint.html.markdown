# azurerm_private_dns_resolver_outbound_endpoint

Manages a Private DNS Resolver Outbound Endpoint.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "west europe"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "example" {
  name                = "example-vnet"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}

resource "azurerm_subnet" "example" {
  name                 = "outbounddns"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.example.name
  address_prefixes     = ["10.0.0.64/28"]

  delegation {
    name = "Microsoft.Network.dnsResolvers"
    service_delegation {
      actions = ["Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/join/action"]
      name    = "Microsoft.Network/dnsResolvers"
    }
  }
}

resource "azurerm_private_dns_resolver" "example" {
  name                = "example-resolver"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  virtual_network_id  = azurerm_virtual_network.example.id
}

resource "azurerm_private_dns_resolver_outbound_endpoint" "example" {
  name                    = "example-endpoint"
  private_dns_resolver_id = azurerm_private_dns_resolver.example.id
  location                = azurerm_private_dns_resolver.example.location
  subnet_id               = azurerm_subnet.example.id
  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }
}
```

## Arguments Reference
