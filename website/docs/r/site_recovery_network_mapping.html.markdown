# azurerm_site_recovery_network_mapping

Manages a site recovery network mapping on Azure. A network mapping decides how to translate connected networks when a VM is migrated from one region to another.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "primary" {
  name     = "tfex-network-mapping-primary"
  location = "West US"
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "secondary" {
  name     = "tfex-network-mapping-secondary"
  location = "East US"
}

resource "azurerm_recovery_services_vault" "vault" {
  name                = "example-recovery-vault"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.secondary.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.secondary.name
  sku                 = "Standard"
}

resource "azurerm_site_recovery_fabric" "primary" {
  name                = "primary-fabric"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.secondary.name
  recovery_vault_name = azurerm_recovery_services_vault.vault.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.primary.location
}

resource "azurerm_site_recovery_fabric" "secondary" {
  name                = "secondary-fabric"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.secondary.name
  recovery_vault_name = azurerm_recovery_services_vault.vault.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.secondary.location
  depends_on          = [azurerm_site_recovery_fabric.primary] # Avoids issues with creating fabrics simultaneously
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "primary" {
  name                = "network1"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.primary.name
  address_space       = ["192.168.1.0/24"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.primary.location
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "secondary" {
  name                = "network2"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.secondary.name
  address_space       = ["192.168.2.0/24"]
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.secondary.location
}

resource "azurerm_site_recovery_network_mapping" "recovery-mapping" {
  name                        = "recovery-network-mapping-1"
  resource_group_name         = azurerm_resource_group.secondary.name
  recovery_vault_name         = azurerm_recovery_services_vault.vault.name
  source_recovery_fabric_name = "primary-fabric"
  target_recovery_fabric_name = "secondary-fabric"
  source_network_id           = azurerm_virtual_network.primary.id
  target_network_id           = azurerm_virtual_network.secondary.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the network mapping. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) Name of the resource group where the vault that should be updated is located. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `recovery_vault_name` - (Required) The name of the vault that should be updated. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_recovery_fabric_name` - (Required) Specifies the ASR fabric where mapping should be created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `target_recovery_fabric_name` - (Required) The Azure Site Recovery fabric object corresponding to the recovery Azure region. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_network_id` - (Required) The id of the primary network. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `target_network_id` - (Required) The id of the recovery network. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Site Recovery Network Mapping.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Site Recovery Network Mapping.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Site Recovery Network Mapping.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Site Recovery Network Mapping.

## Import

Site Recovery Network Mapping can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_site_recovery_network_mapping.mymapping /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/resource-group-name/providers/Microsoft.RecoveryServices/vaults/recovery-vault-name/replicationFabrics/primary-fabric-name/replicationNetworks/azureNetwork/replicationNetworkMappings/mapping-name
```
