Manages an EventGrid Domain

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_eventgrid_domain" "example" {
  name                = "my-eventgrid-domain"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  tags = {
    environment = "Production"
  }
}
```

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the EventGrid Domain resource. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the EventGrid Domain exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `input_schema` - (Optional) Specifies the schema in which incoming events will be published to this domain. Allowed values are `CloudEventSchemaV1_0`, `CustomEventSchema`, or `EventGridSchema`. Defaults to `EventGridSchema`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `input_mapping_fields` - (Optional) A `input_mapping_fields` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `input_mapping_default_values` - (Optional) A `input_mapping_default_values` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - (Optional) Whether or not public network access is allowed for this server. Defaults to `true`.

* `local_auth_enabled` - (Optional) Whether local authentication methods is enabled for the EventGrid Domain. Defaults to `true`.
