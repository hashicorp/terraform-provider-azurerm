# azurerm_stream_analytics_job_storage_account

Manages a Stream Analytics Job Storage Account. Use this resource for managing the Job Storage Account using `Msi` authentication with a `SystemAssigned` identity.

~> **Note:** The Job Storage Account for a Stream Analytics Job can be managed on the `azurerm_stream_analytics_job` resource with the `job_storage_account` block, or with this resource. We do not recommend managing the Job Storage Account through both means as this can lead to conflicts.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_stream_analytics_job" "example" {
  name                                     = "example-job"
  resource_group_name                      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  compatibility_level                      = "1.2"
  data_locale                              = "en-GB"
  events_late_arrival_max_delay_in_seconds = 60
  events_out_of_order_max_delay_in_seconds = 50
  events_out_of_order_policy               = "Adjust"
  output_error_policy                      = "Drop"
  streaming_units                          = 3
  sku_name                                 = "StandardV2"

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  tags = {
    environment = "Example"
  }

  transformation_query = <<QUERY
    SELECT *
    INTO [YourOutputAlias]
    FROM [YourInputAlias]
QUERY

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [job_storage_account]
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "exampleaccount"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_stream_analytics_job_storage_account" "example" {
  stream_analytics_job_id = azurerm_stream_analytics_job.example.id
  storage_account_name    = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  authentication_mode     = "Msi"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `storage_account_key` - (Optional) The Storage Account Key for accessing the Storage Account of the Stream Analytics Job.

-> **Note:** `storage_account_key` must be specified when `authentication_mode` is `ConnectionString` and must be absent if `authentication_mode` is `Msi`.
