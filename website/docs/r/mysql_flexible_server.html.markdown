~> **NOTE:** `identity` is required when `customer_managed_key` is specified.

* `delegated_subnet_id` - (Optional) The ID of the virtual network subnet to create the MySQL Flexible Server. Changing this forces a new MySQL Flexible Server to be created.

* `geo_redundant_backup_enabled` - (Optional) Should geo redundant backup enabled? Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new MySQL Flexible Server to be created.

* `high_availability` - (Optional) A `high_availability` block as defined below.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `maintenance_window` - (Optional) A `maintenance_window` block as defined below.

* `point_in_time_restore_time_in_utc` - (Optional) The point in time to restore from `creation_source_server_id` when `create_mode` is `PointInTimeRestore`. Changing this forces a new MySQL Flexible Server to be created.

* `private_dns_zone_id` - (Optional) The ID of the private DNS zone to create the MySQL Flexible Server. Changing this forces a new MySQL Flexible Server to be created.

~> **NOTE:** The `private_dns_zone_id` is required when setting a `delegated_subnet_id`. The `azurerm_private_dns_zone` should end with suffix `.mysql.database.azure.com`.

* `replication_role` - (Optional) The replication role. Possible value is `None`.

~> **NOTE:** The `replication_role` cannot be set while creating and only can be updated from `Replica` to `None`.

* `sku_name` - (Optional) The SKU Name for the MySQL Flexible Server.

-> **NOTE:** `sku_name` should start with SKU tier `B (Burstable)`, `GP (General Purpose)`, `MO (Memory Optimized)` like `B_Standard_B1s`.

* `source_server_id` - (Optional)The resource ID of the source MySQL Flexible Server to be restored. Required when `create_mode` is `PointInTimeRestore`, `GeoRestore`, and `Replica`. Changing this forces a new MySQL Flexible Server to be created.

* `storage` - (Optional) A `storage` block as defined below.

* `version` - (Optional) The version of the MySQL Flexible Server to use. Possible values are `5.7`, and `8.0.21`. Changing this forces a new MySQL Flexible Server to be created.

* `zone` - (Optional) Specifies the Availability Zone in which this MySQL Flexible Server should be located. Possible values are `1`, `2` and `3`.

-> **Note:** Azure will automatically assign an Availability Zone if one is not specified. If the MySQL Flexible Server fails-over to the Standby Availability Zone, the `zone` will be updated to reflect the current Primary Availability Zone. You can use [Terraform's `ignore_changes` functionality](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) to ignore changes to the `zone` and `high_availability[0].standby_availability_zone` fields should you wish for Terraform to not migrate the MySQL Flexible Server back to it's primary Availability Zone after a fail-over.

-> **Note:** The Availability Zones available depend on the Azure Region that the MySQL Flexible Server is being deployed into - see [the Azure Availability Zones documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies) for more information on which Availability Zones are available in each Azure Region.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the MySQL Flexible Server.

---

A `customer_managed_key` block supports the following:

* `key_vault_key_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Key Vault Key.

* `primary_user_assigned_identity_id` - (Optional) Specifies the primary user managed identity id for a Customer Managed Key. Should be added with `identity_ids`.

* `geo_backup_key_vault_key_id` - (Optional) The ID of the geo backup Key Vault Key. It can't cross region and need Customer Managed Key in same region as geo backup.

* `geo_backup_user_assigned_identity_id` - (Optional) The geo backup user managed identity id for a Customer Managed Key. Should be added with `identity_ids`. It can't cross region and need identity in same region as geo backup.

~> **NOTE:** `primary_user_assigned_identity_id` or `geo_backup_user_assigned_identity_id` is required when `type` is set to `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned`.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of Managed Service Identity that should be configured on this MySQL Flexible Server. The only possible value is `UserAssigned`.

* `identity_ids` - (Required) A list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs to be assigned to this MySQL Flexible Server.

---

A `high_availability` block supports the following:

* `mode` - (Required) The high availability mode for the MySQL Flexible Server. Possibles values are `SameZone` and `ZoneRedundant`.

~> **NOTE:** `storage[0].auto_grow_enabled` must be enabled when `high_availability` is enabled. To change the `high_availability` for a MySQL Flexible Server created with `high_availability` disabled during creation, the resource has to be recreated.

* `standby_availability_zone` - (Optional) Specifies the Availability Zone in which the standby Flexible Server should be located. Possible values are `1`, `2` and `3`.

-> **Note:** Azure will automatically assign an Availability Zone if one is not specified. If the MySQL Flexible Server fails-over to the Standby Availability Zone, the `zone` will be updated to reflect the current Primary Availability Zone. You can use [Terraform's `ignore_changes` functionality](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) to ignore changes to the `zone` and `high_availability[0].standby_availability_zone` fields should you wish for Terraform to not migrate the MySQL Flexible Server back to it's primary Availability Zone after a fail-over.

-> **Note:** The Availability Zones available depend on the Azure Region that the MySQL Flexible Server is being deployed into - see [the Azure Availability Zones documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/geographies/#geographies) for more information on which Availability Zones are available in each Azure Region.

A `maintenance_window` block supports the following:

* `day_of_week` - (Optional) The day of week for maintenance window. Defaults to `0`.

* `start_hour` - (Optional) The start hour for maintenance window. Defaults to `0`.

* `start_minute` - (Optional) The start minute for maintenance window. Defaults to `0`.

---

A `storage` block supports the following:
