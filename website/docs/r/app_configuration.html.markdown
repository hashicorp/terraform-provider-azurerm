# azurerm_app_configuration

Manages an Azure App Configuration.

## Disclaimers

-> **Note:** Version 3.27.0 and later of the Azure Provider include a Feature Toggle which will purge an App Configuration resource on destroy, rather than the default soft-delete. The Provider will automatically recover a soft-deleted App Configuration during creation if one is found. See [the Features block documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/features-block) for more information on Feature Toggles within Terraform.

-> **Note:** Reading and purging soft-deleted App Configurations requires the `Microsoft.AppConfiguration/locations/deletedConfigurationStores/read` and `Microsoft.AppConfiguration/locations/deletedConfigurationStores/purge/action` permission on Subscription scope. Recovering a soft-deleted App Configuration requires the `Microsoft.AppConfiguration/configurationStores/write` permission on Subscription or Resource Group scope. [More information can be found in the Azure Documentation for App Configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/concept-soft-delete#permissions-to-recover-a-deleted-store). See the following links for more information on assigning [Azure custom roles](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/custom-roles) or using the [`azurerm_role_assignment`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/role_assignment) resource to assign a custom role.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_app_configuration" "appconf" {
  name                = "appConf1"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the App Configuration. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the App Configuration. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `encryption` - (Optional) An `encryption` block as defined below.

* `local_auth_enabled` - (Optional) Whether local authentication methods is enabled. Defaults to `true`.

* `public_network_access` - (Optional) The Public Network Access setting of the App Configuration. Possible values are `Enabled` and `Disabled`.

~> **Note:** If `public_network_access` is not specified, the App Configuration will be created as  `Automatic`. However, once a different value is defined, can not be set again as automatic.

* `purge_protection_enabled` - (Optional) Whether Purge Protection is enabled. This field only works for `standard` sku. Defaults to `false`.

!> **Note:** Once Purge Protection has been enabled it's not possible to disable it. Deleting the App Configuration with Purge Protection enabled will schedule the App Configuration to be deleted (which will happen by Azure in the configured number of days).

* `replica` - (Optional) One or more `replica` blocks as defined below.

* `sku` - (Optional) The SKU name of the App Configuration. Possible values are `free` and `standard`. Defaults to `free`.

~> **Note:** Azure does not allow a downgrade from `standard` to `free`.

* `soft_delete_retention_days` - (Optional) The number of days that items should be retained for once soft-deleted. This field only works for `standard` sku. This value can be between `1` and `7` days. Defaults to `7`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **Note:** If Purge Protection is enabled, this field can only be configured one time and cannot be updated.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

An `encryption` block supports the following:

* `key_vault_key_identifier` - (Optional) Specifies the URI of the key vault key used to encrypt data.

* `identity_client_id` - (Optional) Specifies the client id of the identity which will be used to access key vault.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of Managed Service Identity that should be configured on this App Configuration. Possible values are `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned` (to enable both).

* `identity_ids` - (Optional) A list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs to be assigned to this App Configuration.

~> **Note:** This is required when `type` is set to `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned`.

---

A `replica` block supports the following:

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the replica exists.

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the replica.
