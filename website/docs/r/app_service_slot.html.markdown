# azurerm_app_service_slot

Manages an App Service Slot (within an App Service).

!> **NOTE:** This resource has been deprecated in version 3.0 of the AzureRM provider and will be removed in version 4.0. Please use [`azurerm_linux_web_app_slot`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/linux_web_app_slot) and [`azurerm_windows_web_app_slot`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/windows_web_app_slot) resources instead.

-> **Note:** When using Slots - the `app_settings`, `connection_string` and `site_config` blocks on the `azurerm_app_service` resource will be overwritten when promoting a Slot using the `azurerm_app_service_active_slot` resource.
