# azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool

Manages a Load Balancer Backend Address Pool.

~> **NOTE:** When using this resource, the Load Balancer needs to have a FrontEnd IP Configuration Attached

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "LoadBalancerRG"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_public_ip" "example" {
  name                = "PublicIPForLB"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  allocation_method   = "Static"
}

resource "azurerm_lb" "example" {
  name                = "TestLoadBalancer"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name

  frontend_ip_configuration {
    name                 = "PublicIPAddress"
    public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.example.id
  }
}

resource "azurerm_lb_backend_address_pool" "example" {
  loadbalancer_id = azurerm_lb.example.id
  name            = "BackEndAddressPool"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Backend Address Pool. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
  
* `loadbalancer_id` - (Required) The ID of the Load Balancer in which to create the Backend Address Pool. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `tunnel_interface` - (Optional) One or more `tunnel_interface` blocks as defined below.

* `virtual_network_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Virtual Network within which the Backend Address Pool should exist.

---

The `tunnel_interface` block supports the following:

* `identifier` - (Required) The unique identifier of this Gateway Load Balancer Tunnel Interface.

* `type` - (Required) The traffic type of this Gateway Load Balancer Tunnel Interface. Possible values are `None`, `Internal` and `External`.

* `protocol` - (Required) The protocol used for this Gateway Load Balancer Tunnel Interface. Possible values are `None`, `Native` and `VXLAN`.

* `port` - (Required) The port number that this Gateway Load Balancer Tunnel Interface listens to.

## Attributes Reference

* `id` - The ID of the Backend Address Pool.
  
* `backend_ip_configurations` - The Backend IP Configurations associated with this Backend Address Pool.

* `load_balancing_rules` - The Load Balancing Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool.

* `inbound_nat_rules` - An array of the Load Balancing Inbound NAT Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool.

* `outbound_rules` - An array of the Load Balancing Outbound Rules associated with this Backend Address Pool.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:
