# azurerm_storage_data_lake_gen2_path

Manages a Data Lake Gen2 Path in a File System within an Azure Storage Account.

~> **Note:** This resource requires some `Storage` specific roles which are not granted by default. Some of the built-ins roles that can be attributed are [`Storage Account Contributor`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-account-contributor), [`Storage Blob Data Owner`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-owner), [`Storage Blob Data Contributor`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor), [`Storage Blob Data Reader`](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-reader).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplestorageacc"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
  account_kind             = "StorageV2"
  is_hns_enabled           = "true"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_data_lake_gen2_filesystem" "example" {
  name               = "example"
  storage_account_id = azurerm_storage_account.example.id
}
resource "azurerm_storage_data_lake_gen2_path" "example" {
  path               = "example"
  filesystem_name    = azurerm_storage_data_lake_gen2_filesystem.example.name
  storage_account_id = azurerm_storage_account.example.id
  resource           = "directory"
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `path` - (Required) The path which should be created within the Data Lake Gen2 File System in the Storage Account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `filesystem_name` - (Required) The name of the Data Lake Gen2 File System which should be created within the Storage Account. Must be unique within the storage account the queue is located. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `storage_account_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the Storage Account in which the Data Lake Gen2 File System should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource` - (Required) Specifies the type for path to create. Currently only `directory` is supported. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `owner` - (Optional) Specifies the Object ID of the Azure Active Directory User to make the owning user. Possible values also include `$superuser`.

* `group` - (Optional) Specifies the Object ID of the Azure Active Directory Group to make the owning group. Possible values also include `$superuser`.

* `ace` - (Optional) One or more `ace` blocks as defined below to specify the entries for the ACL for the path.

---

An `ace` block supports the following:

* `scope` - (Optional) Specifies whether the ACE represents an `access` entry or a `default` entry. Default value is `access`.

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of entry. Can be `user`, `group`, `mask` or `other`.

* `id` - (Optional) Specifies the Object ID of the Azure Active Directory User or Group that the entry relates to. Only valid for `user` or `group` entries.

* `permissions` - (Required) Specifies the permissions for the entry in `rwx` form. For example, `rwx` gives full permissions but `r--` only gives read permissions.

More details on ACLs can be found here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-access-control#access-control-lists-on-files-and-directories>

~> **Note:** Using the service's ACE inheritance features will not work well with terraform since we cannot handle changes that are taking place out-of-band. Setting the path to inherit its permissions from its parent will result in terraform trying to revert them in the next apply operation.

~> **Note:** The Storage Account requires `account_kind` to be either `StorageV2` or `BlobStorage`. In addition, `is_hns_enabled` has to be set to `true`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Data Lake Gen2 File System.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the path.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the path.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the path.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the path.

## Import

Data Lake Gen2 Paths can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_storage_data_lake_gen2_path.example https://account1.dfs.core.windows.net/fileSystem1/path
```
