* `access` - (Required) The action that should be taken for a specified IP address, subnet range or tag. Acceptable values are `Allow` and `Deny`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `priority` - (Required) The priority for this rule. The value must be at least `150`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_address_prefix` - (Required) The source address prefix or tag to match for the rule. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_port_ranges` - (Optional) The source port ranges to match for the rule. Valid values are `*` (for all ports 0 - 65535) or arrays of ports or port ranges (i.e. `100-200`). The ports should in the range of 0 to 65535 and the port ranges or ports can't overlap. If any other values are provided the request fails with HTTP status code 400. Default value will be `*`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

A `task_scheduling_policy` block supports the following:

* `node_fill_type` - (Optional) Supported values are "Pack" and "Spread". "Pack" means as many tasks as possible (taskSlotsPerNode) should be assigned to each node in the pool before any tasks are assigned to the next node in the pool. "Spread" means that tasks should be assigned evenly across all nodes in the pool.

---

A `user_accounts` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The name of the user account.

* `password` - (Required) The password for the user account.

* `elevation_level` - (Required) The elevation level of the user account. "NonAdmin" - The auto user is a standard user without elevated access. "Admin" - The auto user is a user with elevated access and operates with full Administrator permissions. The default value is nonAdmin.

* `linux_user_configuration` - (Optional) The `linux_user_configuration` block defined below is a linux-specific user configuration for the user account. This property is ignored if specified on a Windows pool. If not specified, the user is created with the default options.

* `windows_user_configuration` - (Optional) The `windows_user_configuration` block defined below is a windows-specific user configuration for the user account. This property can only be specified if the user is on a Windows pool. If not specified and on a Windows pool, the user is created with the default options.

---

A `linux_user_configuration` block supports the following:

* `uid` - (Optional) The group ID for the user account. The `uid` and `gid` properties must be specified together or not at all. If not specified the underlying operating system picks the gid.

* `gid` - (Optional) The user ID of the user account. The `uid` and `gid` properties must be specified together or not at all. If not specified the underlying operating system picks the uid.

* `ssh_private_key` - (Optional) The SSH private key for the user account. The private key must not be password protected. The private key is used to automatically configure asymmetric-key based authentication for SSH between nodes in a Linux pool when the pool's enableInterNodeCommunication property is true (it is ignored if enableInterNodeCommunication is false). It does this by placing the key pair into the user's .ssh directory. If not specified, password-less SSH is not configured between nodes (no modification of the user's .ssh directory is done).

---

A `windows_user_configuration` block supports the following:

* `login_mode` - (Required) Specifies login mode for the user. The default value for VirtualMachineConfiguration pools is interactive mode and for CloudServiceConfiguration pools is batch mode. Values supported are "Batch" and "Interactive".

---

A `windows` block supports the following:

Windows operating system settings on the virtual machine. This property must not be specified if the imageReference specifies a Linux OS image.

* `enable_automatic_updates` - (Optional) Whether automatic updates are enabled on the virtual machine. Defaults to `true`.

---

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Batch Pool.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Batch Pool.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Batch Pool.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Batch Pool.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Batch Pool.

## Import

Batch Pools can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_batch_pool.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myGroup1/providers/Microsoft.Batch/batchAccounts/myBatchAccount1/pools/myBatchPool1
```
