# azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container

Manages a SQL Container within a Cosmos DB Account.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_cosmosdb_account" "example" {
  name                = "tfex-cosmosdb-account"
  resource_group_name = "tfex-cosmosdb-account-rg"
}

resource "azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_database" "example" {
  name                = "example-acsd"
  resource_group_name = data.azurerm_cosmosdb_account.example.resource_group_name
  account_name        = data.azurerm_cosmosdb_account.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container" "example" {
  name                  = "example-container"
  resource_group_name   = data.azurerm_cosmosdb_account.example.resource_group_name
  account_name          = data.azurerm_cosmosdb_account.example.name
  database_name         = azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_database.example.name
  partition_key_paths   = ["/definition/id"]
  partition_key_version = 1
  throughput            = 400

  indexing_policy {
    indexing_mode = "consistent"

    included_path {
      path = "/*"
    }

    included_path {
      path = "/included/?"
    }

    excluded_path {
      path = "/excluded/?"
    }
  }

  unique_key {
    paths = ["/definition/idlong", "/definition/idshort"]
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Cosmos DB SQL Container. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which the Cosmos DB SQL Container is created. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `account_name` - (Required) The name of the Cosmos DB Account to create the container within. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `database_name` - (Required) The name of the Cosmos DB SQL Database to create the container within. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `partition_key_paths` - (Required) A list of partition key paths. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `partition_key_kind` - (Optional) Define a partition key kind. Possible values are `Hash` and `MultiHash`. Defaults to `Hash`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `partition_key_version` - (Optional) Define a partition key version. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Possible values are `1`and `2`. This should be set to `2` in order to use large partition keys.

* `unique_key` - (Optional) One or more `unique_key` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `throughput` - (Optional) The throughput of SQL container (RU/s). Must be set in increments of `100`. The minimum value is `400`. This must be set upon container creation otherwise it cannot be updated without a manual terraform destroy-apply.

* `autoscale_settings` - (Optional) An `autoscale_settings` block as defined below. This must be set upon database creation otherwise it cannot be updated without a manual terraform destroy-apply.

~> **Note:** Switching between autoscale and manual throughput is not supported via Terraform and must be completed via the Azure Portal and refreshed.

* `indexing_policy` - (Optional) An `indexing_policy` block as defined below.

* `default_ttl` - (Optional) The default time to live of SQL container. If missing, items are not expired automatically. If present and the value is set to `-1`, it is equal to infinity, and items don’t expire by default. If present and the value is set to some number `n` – items will expire `n` seconds after their last modified time.

* `analytical_storage_ttl` - (Optional) The default time to live of Analytical Storage for this SQL container. If present and the value is set to `-1`, it is equal to infinity, and items don’t expire by default. If present and the value is set to some number `n` – items will expire `n` seconds after their last modified time.

* `conflict_resolution_policy` - (Optional) A `conflict_resolution_policy` blocks as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

An `autoscale_settings` block supports the following:

* `max_throughput` - (Optional) The maximum throughput of the SQL container (RU/s). Must be between `1,000` and `1,000,000`. Must be set in increments of `1,000`. Conflicts with `throughput`.

---
A `unique_key` block supports the following:

* `paths` - (Required) A list of paths to use for this unique key. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---
An `indexing_policy` block supports the following:

* `indexing_mode` - (Optional) Indicates the indexing mode. Possible values include: `consistent` and `none`. Defaults to `consistent`.

* `included_path` - (Optional) One or more `included_path` blocks as defined below. Either `included_path` or `excluded_path` must contain the `path` `/*`

* `excluded_path` - (Optional) One or more `excluded_path` blocks as defined below. Either `included_path` or `excluded_path` must contain the `path` `/*`

* `composite_index` - (Optional) One or more `composite_index` blocks as defined below.

* `spatial_index` - (Optional) One or more `spatial_index` blocks as defined below.

---

A `spatial_index` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to. According to the service design, all spatial types including `LineString`, `MultiPolygon`, `Point`, and `Polygon` will be applied to the path.

---

An `included_path` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to.

---

An `excluded_path` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path that is excluded from indexing.

---

A `composite_index` block supports the following:

* `index` - (Required) One or more `index` blocks as defined below.

---

An `index` block supports the following:

* `path` - (Required) Path for which the indexing behaviour applies to.

* `order` - (Required) Order of the index. Possible values are `Ascending` or `Descending`.

---

A `conflict_resolution_policy` block supports the following:

* `mode` - (Required) Indicates the conflict resolution mode. Possible values include: `LastWriterWins`, `Custom`.

* `conflict_resolution_path` - (Optional) The conflict resolution path in the case of `LastWriterWins` mode.

* `conflict_resolution_procedure` - (Optional) The procedure to resolve conflicts in the case of `Custom` mode.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the CosmosDB SQL Container.

---

A `spatial_index` block exports the following:

* `types` - A set of spatial types of the path.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the CosmosDB SQL Container.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the CosmosDB SQL Container.

## Import

Cosmos SQL Containers can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_cosmosdb_sql_container.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/group1/providers/Microsoft.DocumentDB/databaseAccounts/account1/sqlDatabases/database1/containers/container1
```
