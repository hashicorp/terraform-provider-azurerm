## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the storage account. Only lowercase Alphanumeric characters allowed. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. This must be unique across the entire Azure service, not just within the resource group.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the storage account. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `account_kind` - (Optional) Defines the Kind of account. Valid options are `BlobStorage`, `BlockBlobStorage`, `FileStorage`, `Storage` and `StorageV2`. Defaults to `StorageV2`.

-> **NOTE:** Changing the `account_kind` value from `Storage` to `StorageV2` will not trigger a force new on the storage account, it will only upgrade the existing storage account from `Storage` to `StorageV2` keeping the existing storage account in place.

* `account_tier` - (Required) Defines the Tier to use for this storage account. Valid options are `Standard` and `Premium`. For `BlockBlobStorage` and `FileStorage` accounts only `Premium` is valid. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** Blobs with a tier of `Premium` are of account kind `StorageV2`.

* `account_replication_type` - (Required) Defines the type of replication to use for this storage account. Valid options are `LRS`, `GRS`, `RAGRS`, `ZRS`, `GZRS` and `RAGZRS`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created when types `LRS`, `GRS` and `RAGRS` are changed to `ZRS`, `GZRS` or `RAGZRS` and vice versa.

* `cross_tenant_replication_enabled` - (Optional) Should cross Tenant replication be enabled? Defaults to `true`.

* `access_tier` - (Optional) Defines the access tier for `BlobStorage`, `FileStorage` and `StorageV2` accounts. Valid options are `Hot` and `Cool`, defaults to `Hot`.

* `edge_zone` - (Optional) Specifies the Edge Zone within the Azure Region where this Storage Account should exist. Changing this forces a new Storage Account to be created.

* `enable_https_traffic_only` - (Optional) Boolean flag which forces HTTPS if enabled, see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/storage-require-secure-transfer/) for more information. Defaults to `true`.

* `min_tls_version` - (Optional) The minimum supported TLS version for the storage account. Possible values are `TLS1_0`, `TLS1_1`, and `TLS1_2`. Defaults to `TLS1_2` for new storage accounts.

-> **NOTE:** At this time `min_tls_version` is only supported in the Public Cloud, China Cloud, and US Government Cloud.

* `allow_nested_items_to_be_public` - (Optional) Allow or disallow nested items within this Account to opt into being public. Defaults to `true`.

-> **NOTE:** At this time `allow_nested_items_to_be_public` is only supported in the Public Cloud, China Cloud, and US Government Cloud.

* `shared_access_key_enabled` - (Optional) Indicates whether the storage account permits requests to be authorized with the account access key via Shared Key. If false, then all requests, including shared access signatures, must be authorized with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Defaults to `true`.

~> **Note:** Terraform uses Shared Key Authorisation to provision Storage Containers, Blobs and other items - when Shared Key Access is disabled, you will need to enable [the `storage_use_azuread` flag in the Provider block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#storage_use_azuread) to use Azure AD for authentication, however not all Azure Storage services support Active Directory authentication.
