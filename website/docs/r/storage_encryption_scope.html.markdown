## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "examplesa"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_encryption_scope" "example" {
  name               = "microsoftmanaged"
  storage_account_id = azurerm_storage_account.example.id
  source             = "Microsoft.Storage"
}
```
