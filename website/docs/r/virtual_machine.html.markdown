# azurerm_virtual_machine

Manages a Virtual Machine.

## Disclaimers

-> **Note:** The `azurerm_virtual_machine` resource has been superseded by the [`azurerm_linux_virtual_machine`](linux_virtual_machine.html) and [`azurerm_windows_virtual_machine`](windows_virtual_machine.html) resources. The existing `azurerm_virtual_machine` resource will continue to be available throughout the 3.x releases however is in a feature-frozen state to maintain compatibility - new functionality will instead be added to the `azurerm_linux_virtual_machine` and `azurerm_windows_virtual_machine` resources.

~> **Note:** Data Disks can be attached either directly on the `azurerm_virtual_machine` resource, or using the `azurerm_virtual_machine_data_disk_attachment` resource - but the two cannot be used together. If both are used against the same Virtual Machine, spurious changes will occur.

## Example Usage (from an Azure Platform Image)

This example provisions a Virtual Machine with Managed Disks. Other examples of the `azurerm_virtual_machine` resource can be found in [the `./examples/virtual-machines` directory within the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples/virtual-machines)
