# azurerm_linux_function_app_on_container

Manages a Containerized Linux Function App on Azure Container Apps.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "linuxfunctionappsa"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_container_app_environment" "example" {
  name                = "Example-Environment"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

}

resource "azurerm_linux_function_app_on_container" "example" {
  name                         = "example-linux-function-app-on-container"
  resource_group_name          = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  container_app_environment_id = azurerm_container_app_environment.example.id

  storage_account_name       = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  storage_account_access_key = azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_access_key

  registry {
    registry_server_url = "docker.io"
    registry_username   = "username"

    app_scale_limit = 15
  }
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Containerized Linux Function App. Changing this forces a new Containerized Linux Function App to be created. See [Function App naming rule](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules#microsoftweb) and [Host ID Collisions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-host/wiki/Host-IDs#host-id-collisions) for more information.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Containerized Linux Function App should exist. Changing this forces a new Containerized Linux Function App to be created.

* `container_app_environment_id` - (Required) The ID of the Container App Environment within which this Containerized Linux Function App should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `site_config` - (Required) A `site_config` block as defined below.

* `app_settings` - (Optional) A map of key-value pairs for [App Settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-app-settings) and custom values.

~> **Note:** Please use `functions_extension_version` to set the function runtime version. Terraform will assign the values to the key `FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION` in app setting.

~> **Note:** For storage related settings, please use related properties that are available such as `storage_account_access_key`. Terraform will assign the value to keys such as `WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING`, `AzureWebJobsStorage` in app_setting.

~> **Note:** For application insight related settings, please use `application_insights_connection_string` and `application_insights_key`. Terraform will assign the value to the key `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` and `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` in app setting.

* `functions_extension_version` - (Optional) The runtime version associated with the Function App. Defaults to `~4`.

* `key_vault_reference_identity_id` - (Optional) The User Assigned Identity ID used for accessing KeyVault secrets. The identity must be assigned to the application in the `identity` block. See [Access vaults with a user-assigned identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references#access-vaults-with-a-user-assigned-identity) for more information.

* `storage_account_access_key` - (Optional) The access key which will be used to access the backend storage account for the Function App. Conflicts with `storage_uses_managed_identity`.

~> **NOTE:** One of `storage_account_access_key` or `key_vault_reference_identity_id` must be specified.

* `storage_account_name` - (Optional) The backend storage account name which will be used by this Function App.

* `storage_uses_managed_identity` - (Optional) Should the Function App use Managed Identity to access the storage account. Conflicts with `storage_account_access_key`.

~> **NOTE:** One of `storage_account_access_key` or `storage_uses_managed_identity` must be specified when using `storage_account_name`.

* `storage_key_vault_secret_id` - (Optional) The Key Vault Secret ID, optionally including version, that contains the Connection String to connect to the storage account for this Function App.

~> **NOTE:** `storage_key_vault_secret_id` cannot be used with `storage_account_name`.

~> **NOTE:** `storage_key_vault_secret_id` used without a version will use the latest version of the secret, however, the service can take up to 24h to pick up a rotation of the latest version. See the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references#rotation) for more information.

* `container_image` - (Required) The name of the Docker image, including image tag to be used.

* `identity` - (Optional) A `identity` block as defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags which should be assigned to the Containerized Linux Function App.

---

A `registry` block supports the following:

* `registry_url` - (Required) The URL of the docker registry.

* `registry_username` - (Optional) The username to use for connections to the registry.

* `registry_password` - (Optional) The password for the account to use to connect to the registry.

---

A `site_config` block supports the following:

* `application_insights_connection_string` - (Optional) The Connection String for linking the Containerized Linux Function App to Application Insights.

* `application_insights_key` - (Optional) The Instrumentation Key for connecting the Containerized Linux Function App to Application Insights.

* `app_scale_limit` - (Optional) The number of workers this function app can scale out to, which is only applicable to apps on the Consumption and Premium plan. The accepted value is from `10` to `30`. Defaults to `10`.

* `elastic_instance_minimum` - (Optional) The number of minimum instances for this Linux Function App. Only affects apps on Elastic Premium plans. The accepted value is from `10` to `30`.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of Managed Service Identity that should be configured on this Linux Function App. Possible values are `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned` (to enable both).

* `identity_ids` - (Optional) A list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs to be assigned to this Linux Function App.

~> **NOTE:** This is required when `type` is set to `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned`.
