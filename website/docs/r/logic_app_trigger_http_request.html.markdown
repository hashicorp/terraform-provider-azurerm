# azurerm_logic_app_trigger_http_request

Manages a HTTP Request Trigger within a Logic App Workflow

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "workflow-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_logic_app_workflow" "example" {
  name                = "workflow1"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_logic_app_trigger_http_request" "example" {
  name         = "some-http-trigger"
  logic_app_id = azurerm_logic_app_workflow.example.id

  schema = <<SCHEMA
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "hello": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    }
}
SCHEMA

}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the HTTP Request Trigger to be created within the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **NOTE:** This name must be unique across all Triggers within the Logic App Workflow.

* `logic_app_id` - (Required) Specifies the ID of the Logic App Workflow. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `schema` - (Required) A JSON Blob defining the Schema of the incoming request. This needs to be valid JSON.

-> **NOTE:** To make the Trigger more readable, you may wish to consider using HEREDOC syntax (as shown above) or [the `local_file` resource](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/local/d/file.html) to load the schema from a file on disk.

* `method` - (Optional) Specifies the HTTP Method which the request be using. Possible values include `DELETE`, `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST` or `PUT`.

* `relative_path` - (Optional) Specifies the Relative Path used for this Request.

-> **NOTE:** When `relative_path` is set a `method` must also be set.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the HTTP Request Trigger within the Logic App Workflow.

* `callback_url` - The URL of the Trigger within the Logic App Workflow. For use with certain resources like [monitor_action_group](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/monitor_action_group) and [security_center_automation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/security_center_automation).

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Logic App HTTP Request Trigger.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Logic App HTTP Request Trigger.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Logic App HTTP Request Trigger.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Logic App HTTP Request Trigger.

## Import

Logic App HTTP Request Triggers can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_logic_app_trigger_http_request.request1 /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/mygroup1/providers/Microsoft.Logic/workflows/workflow1/triggers/request1
```

-> **NOTE:** This ID is unique to Terraform and doesn't directly match to any other resource. To compose this ID, you can take the ID Logic App Workflow and append `/triggers/{name of the trigger}`.
