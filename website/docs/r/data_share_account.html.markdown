* `name` - (Required) The name which should be used for this Data Share Account. Changing this forces a new Data Share Account to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Data Share Account should exist. Changing this forces a new Data Share Account to be created.

* `location` - (Required) The Azure Region where the Data Share Account should exist. Changing this forces a new Data Share Account to be created.

* `identity` - (Required) An `identity` block as defined below. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of Managed Service Identity that should be configured on this Data Share Account. The only possible value is `SystemAssigned`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE:** The assigned `principal_id` and `tenant_id` can be retrieved after the identity `type` has been set to `SystemAssigned` and the Data Share Account has been created. More details are available below.
