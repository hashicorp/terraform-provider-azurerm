# azurerm_kubernetes_cluster

Manages a Managed Kubernetes Cluster (also known as AKS / Azure Kubernetes Service)

-> **Note:** Due to the fast-moving nature of AKS, we recommend using the latest version of the Azure Provider when using AKS - you can find [the latest version of the Azure Provider here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest).

~> **Note:** All arguments including the client secret will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

This example provisions a basic Managed Kubernetes Cluster. Other examples of the `azurerm_kubernetes_cluster` resource can be found in [the `./examples/kubernetes` directory within the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples/kubernetes).

An example of how to attach a specific Container Registry to a Managed Kubernetes Cluster can be found in the docs for [azurerm_container_registry](container_registry.html).

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name                = "example-aks1"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  dns_prefix          = "exampleaks1"

  default_node_pool {
    name       = "default"
    node_count = 1
    vm_size    = "Standard_D2_v2"
  }

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }

  tags = {
    Environment = "Production"
  }
}

output "client_certificate" {
  value     = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.example.kube_config[0].client_certificate
  sensitive = true
}

output "kube_config" {
  value = azurerm_kubernetes_cluster.example.kube_config_raw

  sensitive = true
}
```

This provides a Private IP Address for the Kubernetes API on the Virtual Network where the Kubernetes Cluster is located. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `private_dns_zone_id` - (Optional) Either the ID of Private DNS Zone which should be delegated to this Cluster, `System` to have AKS manage this or `None`. In case of `None` you will need to bring your own DNS server and set up resolving, otherwise, the cluster will have issues after provisioning. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `private_cluster_public_fqdn_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether a Public FQDN for this Private Cluster should be added. Defaults to `false`.

-> **Note:** If you use BYO DNS Zone, the AKS cluster should either use a User Assigned Identity or a service principal (which is deprecated) with the `Private DNS Zone Contributor` role and access to this Private DNS Zone. If `UserAssigned` identity is used - to prevent improper resource order destruction - the cluster should depend on the role assignment, like in this example:

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_private_dns_zone" "example" {
  name                = "privatelink.eastus2.azmk8s.io"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
}

resource "azurerm_user_assigned_identity" "example" {
  name                = "aks-example-identity"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
}

resource "azurerm_role_assignment" "example" {
  scope                = azurerm_private_dns_zone.example.id
  role_definition_name = "Private DNS Zone Contributor"
  principal_id         = azurerm_user_assigned_identity.example.principal_id
}

resource "azurerm_kubernetes_cluster" "example" {
  name                    = "aksexamplewithprivatednszone1"
  location                = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name     = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  dns_prefix              = "aksexamplednsprefix1"
  private_cluster_enabled = true
  private_dns_zone_id     = azurerm_private_dns_zone.example.id

  # rest of configuration omitted for brevity

  depends_on = [
    azurerm_role_assignment.example,
  ]
}

* `https_proxy` - (Optional) The proxy address to be used when communicating over HTTPS.

* `no_proxy` - (Optional) The list of domains that will not use the proxy for communication.

-> **Note:** If you specify the `default_node_pool[0].vnet_subnet_id`, be sure to include the Subnet CIDR in the `no_proxy` list.

-> **Note:** You may wish to use [Terraform's `ignore_changes` functionality](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) to ignore the changes to this field.

* `trusted_ca` - (Optional) The base64 encoded alternative CA certificate content in PEM format.

---

A `upgrade_settings` block supports the following:

* `drain_timeout_in_minutes` - (Optional) The amount of time in minutes to wait on eviction of pods and graceful termination per node. This eviction wait time honors pod disruption budgets for upgrades. If this time is exceeded, the upgrade fails. Unsetting this after configuring it will force a new resource to be created.

* `node_soak_duration_in_minutes` - (Optional) The amount of time in minutes to wait after draining a node and before reimaging and moving on to next node. Defaults to `0`.

* `max_surge` - (Required) The maximum number or percentage of nodes which will be added to the Node Pool size during an upgrade.

-> **Note:** If a percentage is provided, the number of surge nodes is calculated from the `node_count` value on the current cluster. Node surge can allow a cluster to have more nodes than `max_count` during an upgrade. Ensure that your cluster has enough [IP space](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster#customize-node-surge-upgrade) during an upgrade.
