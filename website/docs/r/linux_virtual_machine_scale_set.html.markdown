# azurerm_linux_virtual_machine_scale_set

Manages a Linux Virtual Machine Scale Set.

## Disclaimers

-> **NOTE:** As of the **v2.86.0** (November 19, 2021) release of the provider this resource will only create Virtual Machine Scale Sets with the **Uniform** Orchestration Mode. For Virtual Machine Scale Sets with **Flexible** orchestration mode, use [`azurerm_orchestrated_virtual_machine_scale_set`](orchestrated_virtual_machine_scale_set.html). Flexible orchestration mode is recommended for workloads on Azure.

-> **NOTE:** All arguments including the administrator login and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. [Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

-> **NOTE:** Terraform will automatically update & reimage the nodes in the Scale Set (if Required) during an Update - this behaviour can be configured [using the `features` setting within the Provider block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/guides/features-block).

## Example Usage

This example provisions a basic Linux Virtual Machine Scale Set on an internal network. Additional examples of how to use the `azurerm_linux_virtual_machine_scale_set` resource can be found [in the ./examples/vm-scale-set/linux` directory within the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples/vm-scale-set/linux).

A `rolling_upgrade_policy` block supports the following:

* `cross_zone_upgrades_enabled` - (Optional) Should the Virtual Machine Scale Set ignore the Azure Zone boundaries when constructing upgrade batches? Possible values are `true` or `false`.

* `max_batch_instance_percent` - (Required) The maximum percent of total virtual machine instances that will be upgraded simultaneously by the rolling upgrade in one batch. As this is a maximum, unhealthy instances in previous or future batches can cause the percentage of instances in a batch to decrease to ensure higher reliability.

* `max_unhealthy_instance_percent` - (Required) The maximum percentage of the total virtual machine instances in the scale set that can be simultaneously unhealthy, either as a result of being upgraded, or by being found in an unhealthy state by the virtual machine health checks before the rolling upgrade aborts. This constraint will be checked prior to starting any batch.

* `max_unhealthy_upgraded_instance_percent` - (Required) The maximum percentage of upgraded virtual machine instances that can be found to be in an unhealthy state. This check will happen after each batch is upgraded. If this percentage is ever exceeded, the rolling update aborts.

* `pause_time_between_batches` - (Required) The wait time between completing the update for all virtual machines in one batch and starting the next batch. The time duration should be specified in ISO 8601 format.

* `prioritize_unhealthy_instances_enabled` - (Optional) Upgrade all unhealthy instances in a scale set before any healthy instances. Possible values are `true` or `false`.

* `maximum_surge_instances_enabled` - (Optional) Create new virtual machines to upgrade the scale set, rather than updating the existing virtual machines. Existing virtual machines will be deleted once the new virtual machines are created for each batch. Possible values are `true` or `false`.

-> **NOTE:** `overprovision` must be set to `false` when `maximum_surge_instances_enabled` is specified.

---

A `secret` block supports the following:

* `certificate` - (Required) One or more `certificate` blocks as defined above.

* `key_vault_id` - (Required) The ID of the Key Vault from which all Secrets should be sourced.

---

A `terminate_notification` block supports the following:

* `enabled` - (Required) Should the terminate notification be enabled on this Virtual Machine Scale Set? 

* `timeout` - (Optional) Length of time (in minutes, between 5 and 15) a notification to be sent to the VM on the instance metadata server till the VM gets deleted. The time duration should be specified in ISO 8601 format. Defaults to `PT5M`.

-> **NOTE:** For more information about the terminate notification, please [refer to this doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-terminate-notification).

---

A `termination_notification` block supports the following:

* `enabled` - (Required) Should the termination notification be enabled on this Virtual Machine Scale Set? 

* `timeout` - (Optional) Length of time (in minutes, between 5 and 15) a notification to be sent to the VM on the instance metadata server till the VM gets deleted. The time duration should be specified in ISO 8601 format. Defaults to `PT5M`.

-> **NOTE:** For more information about the termination notification, please [refer to this doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-terminate-notification).

---

A `source_image_reference` block supports the following:

* `publisher` - (Required) Specifies the publisher of the image used to create the virtual machines. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `offer` - (Required) Specifies the offer of the image used to create the virtual machines. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sku` - (Required) Specifies the SKU of the image used to create the virtual machines.

* `version` - (Required) Specifies the version of the image used to create the virtual machines.

---

A `spot_restore` block supports the following:

* `enabled` - (Optional) Should the Spot-Try-Restore feature be enabled? The Spot-Try-Restore feature will attempt to automatically restore the evicted Spot Virtual Machine Scale Set VM instances opportunistically based on capacity availability and pricing constraints. Possible values are `true` or `false`. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `timeout` - (Optional) The length of time that the Virtual Machine Scale Set should attempt to restore the Spot VM instances which have been evicted. The time duration should be between `15` minutes and `120` minutes (inclusive). The time duration should be specified in the ISO 8601 format. Defaults to `PT1H`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
