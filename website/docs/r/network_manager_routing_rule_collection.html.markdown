resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

data "azurerm_subscription" "current" {
}

resource "azurerm_network_manager" "example" {
  name                = "example-network-manager"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  scope {
    subscription_ids = [data.azurerm_subscription.current.id]
  }
  scope_accesses = ["Routing"]
}

resource "azurerm_network_manager_network_group" "example" {
  name               = "example-network-group"
  network_manager_id = azurerm_network_manager.example.id
}

resource "azurerm_network_manager_routing_configuration" "example" {
