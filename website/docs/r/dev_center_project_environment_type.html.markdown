  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location

  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_dev_center_environment_type" "example" {
  name          = "example-et"
  dev_center_id = azurerm_dev_center.example.id
}

resource "azurerm_dev_center_project" "example" {

  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  dev_center_id       = azurerm_dev_center.example.id

  depends_on = [azurerm_dev_center_environment_type.example]
}

resource "azurerm_dev_center_project_environment_type" "example" {
  name                  = "example-et"
  location              = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
