## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Managed Disk. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Managed Disk should exist. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `location` - (Required) Specified the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `storage_account_type` - (Required) The type of storage to use for the managed disk. Possible values are `Standard_LRS`, `StandardSSD_ZRS`, `Premium_LRS`, `PremiumV2_LRS`, `Premium_ZRS`, `StandardSSD_LRS` or `UltraSSD_LRS`.

-> **Note:** Azure Ultra Disk Storage is only available in a region that support availability zones and can only enabled on the following VM series: `ESv3`, `DSv3`, `FSv3`, `LSv2`, `M` and `Mv2`. For more information see the `Azure Ultra Disk Storage` [product documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/disks-enable-ultra-ssd).

* `create_option` - (Required) The method to use when creating the managed disk. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Possible values include: * `Import` - Import a VHD file in to the managed disk (VHD specified with `source_uri`). * `ImportSecure` - Securely import a VHD file in to the managed disk (VHD specified with `source_uri`). * `Empty` - Create an empty managed disk. * `Copy` - Copy an existing managed disk or snapshot (specified with `source_resource_id`). * `FromImage` - Copy a Platform Image (specified with `image_reference_id`) * `Restore` - Set by Azure Backup or Site Recovery on a restored disk (specified with `source_resource_id`). * `Upload` - Upload a VHD disk with the help of SAS URL (to be used with `upload_size_bytes`).

---

* `disk_encryption_set_id` - (Optional) The ID of a Disk Encryption Set which should be used to encrypt this Managed Disk. Conflicts with `secure_vm_disk_encryption_set_id`.

~> **NOTE:** The Disk Encryption Set must have the `Reader` Role Assignment scoped on the Key Vault - in addition to an Access Policy to the Key Vault

~> **NOTE:** Disk Encryption Sets are in Public Preview in a limited set of regions

* `disk_iops_read_write` - (Optional) The number of IOPS allowed for this disk; only settable for UltraSSD disks and PremiumV2 disks. One operation can transfer between 4k and 256k bytes.

* `disk_mbps_read_write` - (Optional) The bandwidth allowed for this disk; only settable for UltraSSD disks and PremiumV2 disks. MBps means millions of bytes per second.

* `disk_iops_read_only` - (Optional) The number of IOPS allowed across all VMs mounting the shared disk as read-only; only settable for UltraSSD disks and PremiumV2 disks with shared disk enabled. One operation can transfer between 4k and 256k bytes.

* `disk_mbps_read_only` - (Optional) The bandwidth allowed across all VMs mounting the shared disk as read-only; only settable for UltraSSD disks and PremiumV2 disks with shared disk enabled. MBps means millions of bytes per second.

* `upload_size_bytes` - (Optional) Specifies the size of the managed disk to create in bytes. Required when `create_option` is `Upload`. The value must be equal to the source disk to be copied in bytes. Source disk size could be calculated with `ls -l` or `wc -c`. More information can be found at [Copy a managed disk](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/disks-upload-vhd-to-managed-disk-cli#copy-a-managed-disk). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `disk_size_gb` - (Optional) (Optional, Required for a new managed disk) Specifies the size of the managed disk to create in gigabytes. If `create_option` is `Copy` or `FromImage`, then the value must be equal to or greater than the source's size. The size can only be increased.

-> **NOTE:** In certain conditions the Data Disk size can be updated without shutting down the Virtual Machine, however only a subset of Virtual Machine SKUs/Disk combinations support this. More information can be found [for Linux Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/expand-disks?tabs=azure-cli%2Cubuntu#expand-without-downtime) and [Windows Virtual Machines](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/expand-os-disk#expand-without-downtime) respectively.

~> **NOTE:** If No Downtime Resizing is not available, be aware that changing this value is disruptive if the disk is attached to a Virtual Machine. The VM will be shut down and de-allocated as required by Azure to action the change. Terraform will attempt to start the machine again after the update if it was in a `running` state when the apply was started.

~> **NOTE:** When upgrading `disk_size_gb` from value less than 4095 to a value greater than 4095, the disk will be detached from its associated Virtual Machine as required by Azure to action the change. Terraform will attempt to reattach the disk again after the update.

* `edge_zone` - (Optional) Specifies the Edge Zone within the Azure Region where this Managed Disk should exist. Changing this forces a new Managed Disk to be created.

* `encryption_settings` - (Optional) A `encryption_settings` block as defined below.

~> **NOTE:** Removing `encryption_settings` forces a new resource to be created.

* `hyper_v_generation` - (Optional) The HyperV Generation of the Disk when the source of an `Import` or `Copy` operation targets a source that contains an operating system. Possible values are `V1` and `V2`. For `ImportSecure` it must be set to `V2`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `image_reference_id` - (Optional) ID of an existing platform/marketplace disk image to copy when `create_option` is `FromImage`. This field cannot be specified if gallery_image_reference_id is specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `gallery_image_reference_id` - (Optional) ID of a Gallery Image Version to copy when `create_option` is `FromImage`. This field cannot be specified if image_reference_id is specified. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `logical_sector_size` - (Optional) Logical Sector Size. Possible values are: `512` and `4096`. Defaults to `4096`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE:** Setting logical sector size is supported only with `UltraSSD_LRS` disks and `PremiumV2_LRS` disks.

* `optimized_frequent_attach_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether this Managed Disk should be optimized for frequent disk attachments (where a disk is attached/detached more than 5 times in a day). Defaults to `false`.

-> **Note:** Setting `optimized_frequent_attach_enabled` to `true` causes the disks to not align with the fault domain of the Virtual Machine, which can have operational implications.

* `performance_plus_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies whether Performance Plus is enabled for this Managed Disk. Defaults to `false`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `os_type` - (Optional) Specify a value when the source of an `Import`, `ImportSecure` or `Copy` operation targets a source that contains an operating system. Valid values are `Linux` or `Windows`.

* `source_resource_id` - (Optional) The ID of an existing Managed Disk or Snapshot to copy when `create_option` is `Copy` or the recovery point to restore when `create_option` is `Restore`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `source_uri` - (Optional) URI to a valid VHD file to be used when `create_option` is `Import` or `ImportSecure`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `storage_account_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Storage Account where the `source_uri` is located. Required when `create_option` is set to `Import` or `ImportSecure`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `tier` - (Optional) The disk performance tier to use. Possible values are documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disks-change-performance). This feature is currently supported only for premium SSDs.

~> **NOTE:** Changing this value is disruptive if the disk is attached to a Virtual Machine. The VM will be shut down and de-allocated as required by Azure to action the change. Terraform will attempt to start the machine again after the update if it was in a `running` state when the apply was started.

* `max_shares` - (Optional) The maximum number of VMs that can attach to the disk at the same time. Value greater than one indicates a disk that can be mounted on multiple VMs at the same time.

-> **Note:** Premium SSD maxShares limit: `P15` and `P20` disks: 2. `P30`,`P40`,`P50` disks: 5. `P60`,`P70`,`P80` disks: 10. For ultra disks the `max_shares` minimum value is 1 and the maximum is 5.

* `trusted_launch_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies if Trusted Launch is enabled for the Managed Disk. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **Note:** Trusted Launch can only be enabled when `create_option` is `FromImage` or `Import`.

* `security_type` - (Optional) Security Type of the Managed Disk when it is used for a Confidential VM. Possible values are `ConfidentialVM_VMGuestStateOnlyEncryptedWithPlatformKey`, `ConfidentialVM_DiskEncryptedWithPlatformKey` and `ConfidentialVM_DiskEncryptedWithCustomerKey`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE:** When `security_type` is set to `ConfidentialVM_DiskEncryptedWithCustomerKey` the value of `create_option` must be one of `FromImage` or `ImportSecure`.


~> **NOTE:** `security_type` cannot be specified when `trusted_launch_enabled` is set to true.

~> **NOTE:** `secure_vm_disk_encryption_set_id` must be specified when `security_type` is set to `ConfidentialVM_DiskEncryptedWithCustomerKey`.

* `secure_vm_disk_encryption_set_id` - (Optional) The ID of the Disk Encryption Set which should be used to Encrypt this OS Disk when the Virtual Machine is a Confidential VM. Conflicts with `disk_encryption_set_id`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

~> **NOTE:** `secure_vm_disk_encryption_set_id` can only be specified when `security_type` is set to `ConfidentialVM_DiskEncryptedWithCustomerKey`.

* `on_demand_bursting_enabled` - (Optional) Specifies if On-Demand Bursting is enabled for the Managed Disk.

-> **Note:** Credit-Based Bursting is enabled by default on all eligible disks. More information on [Credit-Based and On-Demand Bursting can be found in the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/disk-bursting#disk-level-bursting).

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

* `zone` - (Optional) Specifies the Availability Zone in which this Managed Disk should be located. Changing this property forces a new resource to be created.

~> **Note:** Availability Zones are [only supported in select regions at this time](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/availability-zones/az-overview).

* `network_access_policy` - (Optional) Policy for accessing the disk via network. Allowed values are `AllowAll`, `AllowPrivate`, and `DenyAll`.
