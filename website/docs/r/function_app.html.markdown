# azurerm_function_app

Manages a Function App.

!> **NOTE:** This resource has been deprecated in version 3.0 of the AzureRM provider and will be removed in version 4.0. Please use [`azurerm_linux_function_app`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/linux_function_app) and [`azurerm_windows_function_app`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/windows_function_app) resources instead.

~> **Note:** To connect an Azure Function App and a subnet within the same region `azurerm_app_service_virtual_network_swift_connection` can be used.
For an example, check the `azurerm_app_service_virtual_network_swift_connection` documentation.
