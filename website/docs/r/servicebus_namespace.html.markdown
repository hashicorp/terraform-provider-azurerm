# azurerm_servicebus_namespace

Manages a ServiceBus Namespace.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "terraform-servicebus"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_servicebus_namespace" "example" {
  name                = "tfex-servicebus-namespace"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  sku                 = "Standard"

  tags = {
    source = "terraform"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the ServiceBus Namespace resource . Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
    create the namespace.

* `location` - (Required) Specifies the supported Azure location where the resource exists. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `sku` - (Required) Defines which tier to use. Options are `Basic`, `Standard` or `Premium`. Please note that setting this field to `Premium` will force the creation of a new resource.

* `identity` - (Optional) An `identity` block as defined below.

* `capacity` - (Optional) Specifies the capacity. When `sku` is `Premium`, capacity can be `1`, `2`, `4`, `8` or `16`. When `sku` is `Basic` or `Standard`, capacity can be `0` only.

* `premium_messaging_partitions` - (Optional) Specifies the number messaging partitions. Only valid when `sku` is `Premium` and the minimum number is `1`. Possible values include `0`, `1`, `2`, and `4`. Defaults to `0` for Standard, Basic namespace. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

-> **Note:** It's not possible to change the partitioning option on any existing namespace. The number of partitions can only be set during namespace creation. Please check the doc https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-bus-messaging/enable-partitions-premium for more feature restrictions. 

* `customer_managed_key` - (Optional) An `customer_managed_key` block as defined below.

* `local_auth_enabled` - (Optional) Whether or not SAS authentication is enabled for the Service Bus namespace. Defaults to `true`.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - (Optional) Is public network access enabled for the Service Bus Namespace? Defaults to `true`.

* `minimum_tls_version` - (Optional) The minimum supported TLS version for this Service Bus Namespace. Valid values are: `1.0`, `1.1` and `1.2`. The current default minimum TLS version is `1.2`.

* `zone_redundant` - (Optional) Whether or not this resource is zone redundant. `sku` needs to be `Premium`. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `network_rule_set` - (Optional) An `network_rule_set` block as defined below.

* `tags` - (Optional) A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

---

An `identity` block supports the following:

* `type` - (Required) Specifies the type of Managed Service Identity that should be configured on this ServiceBus Namespace. Possible values are `SystemAssigned`, `UserAssigned`, `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned` (to enable both).

* `identity_ids` - (Optional) Specifies a list of User Assigned Managed Identity IDs to be assigned to this ServiceBus namespace.

~> **NOTE:** This is required when `type` is set to `UserAssigned` or `SystemAssigned, UserAssigned`.

---

-> **Note:** Once customer-managed key encryption has been enabled, it cannot be disabled.

---

A `customer_managed_key` block supports the following:

* `key_vault_key_id` - (Required) The ID of the Key Vault Key which should be used to Encrypt the data in this ServiceBus Namespace.

* `identity_id` - (Required) The ID of the User Assigned Identity that has access to the key.

* `infrastructure_encryption_enabled` - (Optional) Used to specify whether enable Infrastructure Encryption (Double Encryption). Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

---

A `network_rule_set` block supports the following:

* `default_action` - (Optional) Specifies the default action for the Network Rule Set. Possible values are `Allow` and `Deny`. Defaults to `Allow`.

* `public_network_access_enabled` - (Optional) Whether to allow traffic over public network. Possible values are `true` and `false`. Defaults to `true`.

* `network_rules` - (Optional) One or more `network_rules` blocks as defined below.

---

A `network_rules` block supports the following:

* `subnet_id` - (Required) The Subnet ID which should be able to access this ServiceBus Namespace.
