# azurerm_container_group

Manages as an Azure Container Group instance.

~> **Note** `network_profile_id` is [deprecated](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-instances/container-instances-vnet) by Azure. For users who want to continue to manage existing `azurerm_container_group` that rely on `network_profile_id`, please stay on provider versions prior to v3.16.0. Otherwise, use `subnet_ids` instead.

## Example Usage

This example provisions a Basic Container. Other examples of the `azurerm_container_group` resource can be found in [the `./examples/container-instance` directory within the GitHub Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/tree/main/examples/container-instance).

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_container_group" "example" {
  name                = "example-continst"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  ip_address_type     = "Public"
  dns_name_label      = "aci-label"
  os_type             = "Linux"

  container {
    name   = "hello-world"
    image  = "mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld:latest"
    cpu    = "0.5"
    memory = "1.5"

    ports {
      port     = 443
      protocol = "TCP"
    }
  }

  container {
    name   = "sidecar"
    image  = "mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-tutorial-sidecar"
    cpu    = "0.5"
    memory = "1.5"
  }

  tags = {
    environment = "testing"
  }
}
```
