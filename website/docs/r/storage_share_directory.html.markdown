# azurerm_storage_share_directory

Manages a Directory within an Azure Storage File Share.

-> **Note on Permissions** When using Azure Active Directory Authentication (i.e. setting the provider property `storage_use_azuread = true`), the principal running Terraform must have the *Storage File Data Privileged Contributor* IAM role assigned. The *Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor* does not have sufficient permissions to create directories. Refer to [official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/authorize-with-azure-active-directory#permissions-for-file-service-operations) for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "azuretest"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "azureteststorage"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_share" "example" {
  name                 = "sharename"
  storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.example.name
  quota                = 50
}

resource "azurerm_storage_share_directory" "example" {
  name             = "example"
  storage_share_id = azurerm_storage_share.example.id
}
```

* `metadata` - (Optional) A mapping of metadata to assign to this Directory.

## Attributes Reference

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Storage Share Directory.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Storage Share Directory.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Storage Share Directory.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Storage Share Directory.
