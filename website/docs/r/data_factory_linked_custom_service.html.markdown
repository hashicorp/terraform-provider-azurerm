# azurerm_data_factory_linked_custom_service

Manages a Linked Service (connection) between a resource and Azure Data Factory. This is a generic resource that supports all different Linked Service Types.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "example-resources"
  location = "West Europe"
}

resource "azurerm_data_factory" "example" {
  name                = "example"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  identity {
    type = "SystemAssigned"
  }
}

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "example" {
  name                     = "example"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.example.name
  location                 = azurerm_resource_group.example.location
  account_kind             = "BlobStorage"
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
}

resource "azurerm_data_factory_linked_custom_service" "example" {
  name                 = "example"
  data_factory_id      = azurerm_data_factory.example.id
  type                 = "AzureBlobStorage"
  description          = "test description"
  type_properties_json = <<JSON
{
  "connectionString":"${azurerm_storage_account.example.primary_connection_string}"
}
JSON

  parameters = {
    "foo" : "bar"
    "Env" : "Test"
  }

  annotations = [
    "test1",
    "test2",
    "test3"
  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Data Factory Linked Service. Changing this forces a new resource to be created. Must be unique within a data factory. See the [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/naming-rules) for all restrictions.

* `data_factory_id` - (Required) The Data Factory ID in which to associate the Linked Service with. Changing this forces a new resource.

* `type` - (Required) The type of data stores that will be connected to Data Factory. For full list of supported data stores, please refer to [Azure Data Factory connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-overview). Please refer to [Microsoft.DataFactory factories/linkedservices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/templates/microsoft.datafactory/factories/linkedservices?pivots=deployment-language-terraform) for the type values syntax. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `type_properties_json` - (Required) A JSON object that contains the properties of the Data Factory Linked Service.

* `additional_properties` - (Optional) A map of additional properties to associate with the Data Factory Linked Service.

* `annotations` - (Optional) List of tags that can be used for describing the Data Factory Linked Service.

* `description` - (Optional) The description for the Data Factory Linked Service.

* `integration_runtime` - (Optional) An `integration_runtime` block as defined below.

* `parameters` - (Optional) A map of parameters to associate with the Data Factory Linked Service.

---

An `integration_runtime` block supports the following:

* `name` - (Required) The integration runtime reference to associate with the Data Factory Linked Service.

* `parameters` - (Optional) A map of parameters to associate with the integration runtime.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Data Factory Linked Service.

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `create` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when creating the Data Factory Linked Service.
* `update` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when updating the Data Factory Linked Service.
* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Data Factory Linked Service.
* `delete` - (Defaults to 30 minutes) Used when deleting the Data Factory Linked Service.

## Import

Data Factory Linked Service's can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.

```shell
terraform import azurerm_data_factory_linked_custom_service.example /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/example/providers/Microsoft.DataFactory/factories/example/linkedservices/example
```
