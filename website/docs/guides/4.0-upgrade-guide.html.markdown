# Azure Provider

## Azure Provider Version v4.0

The last major release for the Azure Provider was in March 2022. Since then we've added support for nearly 340 Resources and 120 Data Sources, bringing the total supported features to 1101 Resources and 358 Data Sources at the time of writing this guide.

### Considerations

Version 4.0 of the Azure Provider is a major release and includes breaking changes which are outlined in this document.

When upgrading to version 4.0 of the Azure Provider, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of Terraform Core ([which can be found here](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)).

This guide will continue to receive updates as we incorporate feedback and continue to fix any issues during the Beta.

### Pinning your Provider Version

We recommend pinning the version of each Provider you use in Terraform - you can do this using the `version` attribute within the `required_providers` block, either to a specific version of the Azure Provider, like so:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=3.114.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

.. or to any 3.x release:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "~> 3.x"
    }
  }
}

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

More information on [how to pin the version of a Terraform Provider being used can be found on the Terraform Website](https://www.terraform.io/language/providers/requirements#requiring-providers).

* [Breaking Changes in Data Sources](#behaviour-changes-and-removed-properties-in-data-sources)

## Improved Resource Provider Registration

Previously the Azure Provider had an all(*) or nothing approach to Azure Resource Provider (RP) registration, where the provider would either attempt to register a set of 68 RPs upon provider initialization, or RP registration could be skipped entirely by setting `skip_provider_registration = true` in the provider block.

The inflexibility of this method has been a pain point and is also at odds with the recommendations from Microsoft, which is to only register RPs as needed.

RP registration in 4.0 has been revamped to provide users with more control over which RPs to automatically register or whether to continue managing RP registration outside the provider.

We've introduced two new feature flags in the provider block:

* `resource_provider_registrations` - This has 5 possible modes which are detailed below, that determine the set of RPs to automatically register on the subscription.
    * `core` - A minimal set of RPs that are deemed necessary for a subscription, the list of RPs in this set can be found [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/main/internal/resourceproviders/required.go#L33-L44)
    * `extended` - An expanded set of RPs as suggested by the community, the list of RPs in this set can be found [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/main/internal/resourceproviders/required.go#L47-L91)
    * `all` - A complete set of RPs that might be needed to utilize any functionality in the provider, the list of RPs in this set can be found [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/main/internal/resourceproviders/required.go#L47-L91)
    * `none` - No resource providers should be automatically registered, this is equivalent to setting `skip_provider_registration = true`
    * `legacy` - A set of automatically registered RPs from earlier versions of the provider, this is only provided for forwards compatibility and will be removed in a future major version release, the list of RPs in this set can be found [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/blob/main/internal/resourceproviders/required.go#L120-L191)

* `resource_providers_to_register` - A custom list of RPs to explicitly register for the subscription, in addition to those specified by the `resource_provider_registrations` property

Below are examples of how the two properties can be used.

Only register a minimal set of `core` RPs on the subscription
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  resource_provider_registrations = "core"
}
```

Register a set of specific RPs in addition to the `core` RPs on the subscription
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  resource_provider_registrations = "core"

  resource_providers_to_register = [
    "Microsoft.ContainerService",
    "Microsoft.KeyVault",
  ]
}
```

Only register a custom set of RPs defined under `resource_providers_to_register` on the subscription
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  resource_provider_registrations = "none"

  resource_providers_to_register = [
    "Microsoft.ApiManagement",
    "Microsoft.Compute",
    "Microsoft.KeyVault",
    "Microsoft.Network",
    "Microsoft.Storage",
  ]
}
```

(*)all in this case refers to the arbitrary list of Resource Providers that was used for registration

## Specifying Subscription ID is now Mandatory

In version 4.0 of the Azure Provider, it's now required to specify the Azure Subscription ID when configuring a provider instance in your configuration. This can be done by specifying the `subscription_id` provider property, or by exporting the `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable. For example:

Specify the subscription ID in the provider block
```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "00000000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
}
```

Specify the subscription ID using an environment variable
```shell
# Bash etc.
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=00000000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
```powershell
# PowerShell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID', '00000000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

This change will not impact users who use any authentication method other than Azure CLI, for example those authenticating as a service principal using the provider's native support, users authenticating using OIDC, or authenticating using managed identity.

Users authenticating the provider using Azure CLI, however, may previously have elected to omit the subscription ID from their Terraform configuration and rely on the provider selecting the currently active subscription from Azure CLI. Whilst convenient, this behavior has historically led to a number of issues. In particular, when omitting the subscription ID, the provider cannot guarantee that a plan is executed against the correct subscription.

By making it mandatory to specify the subscription ID for all authentication methods, this will also make it possible to implement a number of improvements to our authentication support in the future.

## Provider Functions

With the addition of Provider Functions in Terraform 1.8, we've added two Azure specific provider functions to give users the ability to correct the casing of their Resource IDs, or to access the individual components of it.

`normalise_resource_id` - Takes an Azure Resource ID and attempts to normalise the case-sensitive system segments as required by the Azure Provider. User specified segments are not affected or corrected. 

Below is an example of how the function can be used. The input is a resource ID with segments that are not camel-cased.
```hcl
output "test" {
  value = provider::azurerm::normalise_resource_id("/Subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/ResourceGroups/resGroup1/PROVIDERS/microsoft.apimanagement/service/service1/gateWays/gateway1/hostnameconfigurations/config1")
}

# Result: /subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/resourceGroups/resGroup1/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/service1/gateways/gateway1/hostnameConfigurations/config1
```

`parse_resource_id` - Takes an Azure Resource ID and splits it into its component parts.

Below is an example of how the function can be used. Any resource ID can be provided as input and will be output as a map.
## Example Usage

```hcl
locals {
  parsed_id = provider::azurerm::parse_resource_id("/subscriptions/12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012/resourceGroups/resGroup1/providers/Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/service1/gateways/gateway1/hostnameConfigurations/config1")
}
output "parsed" {
  value = local.parsed_id
}
output "resource_name" {
  value = local.parsed_id["resource_name"]
}

# Result:
# Outputs:
# 
# parsed = {
# "full_resource_type" = "Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/gateways/hostnameConfigurations"
# "parent_resources" = tomap({
# "gateways" = "gateway1"
# "service" = "service1"
# })
# "resource_group_name" = "resGroup1"
# "resource_name" = "config1"
# "resource_provider" = "Microsoft.ApiManagement"
# "resource_scope" = tostring(null)
# "resource_type" = "hostnameConfigurations"
# "subscription_id" = "12345678-1234-9876-4563-123456789012"
# }
# resource_name = "config1"
```

## Additional Properties for Subnets in the Virtual Network Resource

The `subnet` block within the `azurerm_virtual_network_resource` has been updated to include the following new properties:

* `default_outbound_access_enabled`
* `delegation`
* `private_endpoint_network_policies`
* `private_link_service_network_policies_enabled`
* `route_table_id`
* `service_endpoints`
* `service_endpoint_policy_ids`

In addition to the new properties `address_prefix` has been replaced by `address_prefixes` to allow multiple CIDRs in both IPv4 and IPv6 notation.

When upgrading to 4.0, users may receive a warning that the resource needs to be replaced, this should however just be an update in-place.
