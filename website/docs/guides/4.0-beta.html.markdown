# Opting into Beta Functionality coming in version 4.0 of the Azure Provider

Version 4.0 of the Azure Provider will introduce several new features ([full details can be found in the 4.0 Upgrade Guide](/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/4.0-upgrade-guide.html)):

- Improved control and granularity over Resource Provider registration
- Provider functions
- Additional configuration options for Subnets defined in-line in the Virtual Network Resource.
- Improved consistency in updating and removing lists and blocks

Since both Azure and Terraform's Azure Provider move quickly - in order to continue rapidly shipping new features we've used Feature Toggles to gradually add support for the new functionality coming in version 4.0 of the Azure Provider as we've been developing 3.x versions of the Azure Provider.

What this means is that the most recent 3.x versions of the Azure Provider are able to opt-into certain functionality coming in version 4.0 of the Azure Provider.

This guide details how to enable these features and how you can submit feedback prior to the final release.

## Disclaimers

-> The functionality provided in this Beta is subject to change - as such **this Beta should not be used in Production**.

-> Once opted in, it will not be possible to opt-out of the Beta, this is because the new functionality and removal of deprecated functionality in 4.0 will make **irreversible changes to the Terraform state**. We recommend making backups of your environment and state files before activating the Beta in case a rollback of the environment is required.

-> Whilst certain feature flags may be available in earlier versions of the Azure Provider they existed in an incomplete manner - **the Beta is only supported when using version 3.114 (or later) of the Azure Provider**.

## 4.0 Features, Removals and Deprecations

It's possible to opt into the Beta by setting the Environment Variable `ARM_FOURPOINTZERO_BETA` to `true`.

On a macOS/Linux system you can do this via:

```bash
export ARM_FOURPOINTZERO_BETA=true
```

On a Windows System (in PowerShell) you can do this via:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ARM_FOURPOINTZERO_BETA', 'true', [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::User)
```

-> **Note:** You may need to reload/re-open your Terminal after setting this Environment Variable.
