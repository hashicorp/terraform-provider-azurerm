# Azure Provider: Authenticating using a Service Principal with a Client Secret

Terraform supports a number of different methods for authenticating to Azure:

* [Authenticating to Azure using the Azure CLI](azure_cli.html)
* [Authenticating to Azure using Managed Service Identity](managed_service_identity.html)
* [Authenticating to Azure using a Service Principal and a Client Certificate](service_principal_client_certificate.html)
* Authenticating to Azure using a Service Principal and a Client Secret (which is covered in this guide)
* [Authenticating to Azure using a Service Principal and OpenID Connect](service_principal_oidc.html)
* [Authenticating to Azure using AKS Workload Identity](aks_workload_identity.html)

---

We recommend using either a Service Principal or Managed Service Identity when running Terraform non-interactively (such as when running Terraform in a CI server) - and authenticating using the Azure CLI when running Terraform locally.

## Creating a Service Principal

A Service Principal is an application within Azure Active Directory whose authentication tokens can be used as the `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `tenant_id` fields needed by Terraform (`subscription_id` can be independently recovered from your Azure account details).

It's possible to complete this task in either the [Azure CLI](#creating-a-service-principal-using-the-azure-cli) or in the [Azure Portal](#creating-a-service-principal-in-the-azure-portal) - in both we'll create a Service Principal which has `Contributor` rights to the subscription. [It's also possible to assign other rights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles) depending on your configuration.

### Creating a Service Principal using the Azure CLI

~> **Note:** If you're using the **China** or **US Government** Azure Clouds - you'll need to first configure the Azure CLI to work with that Cloud.  You can do this by running:

```shell
az cloud set --name AzureChinaCloud|AzureUSGovernment
```

---

Firstly, login to the Azure CLI using:

```shell
az login
```

Once logged in - it's possible to list the Subscriptions associated with the account via:

```shell
az account list
```

The output (similar to below) will display one or more Subscriptions - with the `id` field being the `subscription_id` field referenced above.

```json
[
  {
    "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
    "id": "20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "isDefault": true,
    "name": "PAYG Subscription",
    "state": "Enabled",
    "tenantId": "10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    "user": {
      "name": "user@example.com",
      "type": "user"
    }
  }
]
```

Should you have more than one Subscription, you can specify the Subscription to use via the following command:

```shell
az account set --subscription="20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

We can now create the Service Principal which will have permissions to manage resources in the specified Subscription using the following command:

```shell
az ad sp create-for-rbac --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```

This command will output 5 values:

```json
{
  "appId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "displayName": "azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15",
  "name": "http://azure-cli-2017-06-05-10-41-15",
  "password": "0000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
  "tenant": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

These values map to the Terraform variables like so:

* `appId` is the `client_id` defined above.
* `password` is the `client_secret` defined above.
* `tenant` is the `tenant_id` defined above.

---

Finally, it's possible to test these values work as expected by first logging in:

```shell
az login --service-principal -u CLIENT_ID -p CLIENT_SECRET --tenant TENANT_ID
```

Once logged in as the Service Principal - we should be able to list the VM sizes by specifying an Azure region, for example here we use the `West US` region:

```shell
az vm list-sizes --location westus
```

~> **Note:** If you're using the **China** or **Government** Azure Clouds - you will need to switch `westus` out for another region. You can find which regions are available by running:

```shell
az account list-locations
```

Finally, since we're logged into the Azure CLI as a Service Principal we recommend logging out of the Azure CLI (but you can instead log in using your user account):

```bash
az logout
```

Information on how to configure the Provider block using the newly created Service Principal credentials can be found below.

### Creating a Service Principal in the Azure Portal

There are three tasks necessary to create a Service Principal using [the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com):

 1. Create an Application in Azure Active Directory, which will create an associated Service Principal
 2. Generating a Client Secret for the Azure Active Directory Application, which you'll to authenticate
 3. Grant the Service Principal access to manage resources in your Azure subscriptions

### 1. Creating an Application in Azure Active Directory

Firstly navigate to [the **Azure Active Directory** overview](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview) within the Azure Portal - [then select the **App Registration** blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps/RegisteredApps/Overview). Click the **New registration** button at the top to add a new Application within Azure Active Directory. On this page, set the following values then press **Create**:

* **Name** - this is a friendly identifier and can be anything (e.g. "Terraform")
* **Supported Account Types** - this should be set to "Accounts in this organizational directory only (single-tenant)"
* **Redirect URI** - you should choose "Web" for the URI type. the actual value can be left blank

At this point the newly created Azure Active Directory application should be visible on-screen - if it's not, navigate to the [the **App Registration** blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps/RegisteredApps/Overview) and select the Azure Active Directory application.

At the top of this page, you'll need to take note of the "Application (client) ID" and the "Directory (tenant) ID", which you can use for the values of `client_id` and `tenant_id` respectively.

### 2. Generating a Client Secret for the Azure Active Directory Application

Now that the Azure Active Directory Application exists we can create a Client Secret which can be used for authentication - to do this select **Certificates & secrets**. This screen displays the Certificates and Client Secrets (i.e. passwords) which are associated with this Azure Active Directory Application.

On this screen, we can generate a new Client Secret by clicking the **New client secret** button, then entering a Description and selecting an Expiry Date, and then pressing **Add**. Once the Client Secret has been generated it will be displayed on screen - _this is only displayed once_ so **be sure to copy it now** (otherwise you will need to regenerate a new secret). This value is the `client_secret` you will need it.

### 3. Granting the Application access to manage resources in your Azure Subscription

Once the Application exists in Azure Active Directory - we can grant it permissions to modify resources in the Subscription. To do this, [navigate to the **Subscriptions** blade within the Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade), then select the Subscription you wish to use, then click **Access Control (IAM)**, and finally **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

Firstly, specify a Role which grants the appropriate permissions needed for the Service Principal (for example, `Contributor` will grant Read/Write on all resources in the Subscription). There's more information about [the built in roles available here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles).

Secondly, search for and select the name of the Service Principal created in Azure Active Directory to assign it this role - then press **Save**.

### Configuring the Service Principal in Terraform

As we've obtained the credentials for this Service Principal - it's possible to configure them in a few different ways.

When storing the credentials as Environment Variables, for example:

```shell-session
# sh
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="12345678-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```
```powershell
# PowerShell
> $env:ARM_CLIENT_ID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
> $env:ARM_CLIENT_SECRET = "12345678-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
> $env:ARM_TENANT_ID = "10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
> $env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID = "20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```
The following Terraform and Provider blocks can be specified - where `3.0.0` is the version of the Azure Provider that you'd like to use:

```hcl
# We strongly recommend using the required_providers block to set the
# Azure Provider source and version being used
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=3.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
```

More information on [the fields supported in the Provider block can be found here](../index.html#argument-reference).

At this point running either `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` should allow Terraform to run using the Service Principal to authenticate.

---

It's also possible to configure these variables either in-line or from using variables in Terraform (as the `client_secret` is in this example), like so:

~> **Caution** We recommend not defining these variables in-line since they could easily be checked into Source Control.

```hcl
variable "client_secret" {
}

# We strongly recommend using the required_providers block to set the
# Azure Provider source and version being used
terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = "=3.0.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}

  client_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  client_secret   = var.client_secret
  tenant_id       = "10000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  subscription_id = "20000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
```

More information on [the fields supported in the Provider block can be found here](../index.html#argument-reference).

At this point running either `terraform plan` or `terraform apply` should allow Terraform to run using the Service Principal to authenticate.
