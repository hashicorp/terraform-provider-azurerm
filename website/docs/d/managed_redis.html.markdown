# Data Source: azurerm_managed_redis

Use this data source to access information about an existing Managed Redis instance.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_managed_redis" "example" {
  name                = "example-managed-redis"
  resource_group_name = "example-resources"
}

output "managed_redis_hostname" {
  value = data.azurerm_managed_redis.example.hostname
}

output "managed_redis_primary_access_key" {
  value       = data.azurerm_managed_redis.example.default_database[0].primary_access_key
  description = "The Managed Redis primary access key."
  sensitive   = true
}

output "managed_redis_secondary_access_key" {
  value       = data.azurerm_managed_redis.example.default_database[0].secondary_access_key
  description = "The Managed Redis secondary access key."
  sensitive   = true
}
```
