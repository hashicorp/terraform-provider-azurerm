# azurerm_mobile_network_packet_core_control_plane

Get information about a Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_mobile_network_packet_core_control_plane" "example" {
  name                = "example-mnpccp"
  resource_group_name = "example-rg"
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - The name of the Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane. 

* `resource_group_name` - The name of the Resource Group where the Mobile Network Packet Core Control Plane exists.
