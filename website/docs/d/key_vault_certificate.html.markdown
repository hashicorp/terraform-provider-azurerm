# Data Source: azurerm_key_vault_certificate

Use this data source to access information about an existing Key Vault Certificate.

~> **Note:** All arguments including the secret value will be stored in the raw state as plain-text.
[Read more about sensitive data in state](/docs/state/sensitive-data.html).

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_key_vault" "example" {
  name                = "examplekv"
  resource_group_name = "some-resource-group"
}

data "azurerm_key_vault_certificate" "example" {
  name         = "secret-sauce"
  key_vault_id = data.azurerm_key_vault.example.id
}

output "certificate_thumbprint" {
  value = data.azurerm_key_vault_certificate.example.thumbprint
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - Specifies the name of the Key Vault Certificate.

* `key_vault_id` - Specifies the ID of the Key Vault instance where the Secret resides, available on the `azurerm_key_vault` Data Source / Resource.

* `version` - (Optional) Specifies the version of the certificate to look up.  (Defaults to latest)

-> **Note:** The vault must be in the same subscription as the provider. If the vault is in another subscription, you must create an aliased provider for that subscription.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Key Vault Certificate ID.

* `name` - Specifies the name of the Key Vault Certificate.

* `secret_id` - The ID of the associated Key Vault Secret.

* `version` - The current version of the Key Vault Certificate.

* `versionless_id` - The Base ID of the Key Vault Certificate.

* `versionless_secret_id` - The Base ID of the Key Vault Secret.

* `certificate_data` - The raw Key Vault Certificate data represented as a hexadecimal string.

* `certificate_data_base64` - The raw Key Vault Certificate data represented as a base64 string.

* `thumbprint` - The X509 Thumbprint of the Key Vault Certificate represented as a hexadecimal string.

* `certificate_policy` - A `certificate_policy` block as defined below.

* `expires` - Expiry date of certificate in RFC3339 format.

* `not_before` - Not Before date of certificate in RFC3339 format.

* `tags` - A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.

* `resource_manager_id` - The (Versioned) ID for this Key Vault Certificate. This property points to a specific version of a Key Vault Certificate, as such using this won't auto-rotate values if used in other Azure Services.

* `resource_manager_versionless_id` - The Versionless ID of the Key Vault Certificate. This property allows other Azure Services (that support it) to auto-rotate their value when the Key Vault Certificate is updated.
