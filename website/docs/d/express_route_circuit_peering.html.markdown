# azurerm_express_route_circuit_peering

Manages an ExpressRoute Circuit Peering.

## Example Usage (Creating a Microsoft Peering)

```hcl
data "azurerm_express_route_circuit_peering" "example" {
  name                       = "example-peering"
  express_route_circuit_name = "example-expressroute"
  resource_group_name        = "example-resources"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `peering_type` - (Required) The type of the ExpressRoute Circuit Peering. Acceptable values include `AzurePrivatePeering`, `AzurePublicPeering` and `MicrosoftPeering`.

* `express_route_circuit_name` - (Required) The name of the ExpressRoute Circuit in which to create the Peering. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the resource group in which to create the Express Route Circuit Peering. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
