# Data Source: azurerm_vpn_gateway

Use this data source to access information about an existing VPN Gateway within a Virtual Hub.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_vpn_gateway" "example" {
  name                = "existing-local-vpn_gateway"
  resource_group_name = "existing-vpn_gateway"
}

output "azurerm_vpn_gateway_id" {
  value = data.azurerm_vpn_gateway.example.id
}
```
