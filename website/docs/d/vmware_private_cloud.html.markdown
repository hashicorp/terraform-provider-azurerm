# Data Source: azurerm_vmware_private_cloud

Use this data source to access information about an existing Azure VMware Solution Private Cloud.

## Example Usage

~> **NOTE :**  Normal `terraform apply` could ignore this note. Please disable correlation request id for continuous operations in one build (like acctest). The continuous operations like `update` or `delete` could not be triggered when it shares the same `correlation-id` with its previous operation.

```hcl
data "azurerm_vmware_private_cloud" "example" {
  name                = "existing-vmware-private-cloud"
  resource_group_name = "existing-resgroup"
}

output "id" {
  value = data.azurerm_vmware_private_cloud.example.id
}
```
