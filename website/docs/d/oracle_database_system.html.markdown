# Data Source: azurerm_oracle_database_system

Use this data source to access information about an existing Database System.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_oracle_database_system" "example" {
  name                = "existing"
  resource_group_name = "existing"
}

output "id" {
  value = data.azurerm_oracle_database_system.example.id
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of this Database System.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Database System exists.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported: 

* `id` - The ID of the Database System.

* `cluster_name` - The cluster name for Exadata and 2-node RAC virtual machine Database systems. The cluster name must begin with an alphabetic character, and may contain hyphens (-). Underscores (_) are not permitted. The cluster name can be no longer than 11 characters and is not case sensitive.

* `compute_count` - The number of compute servers for the Database system.

* `compute_model` - The compute model for Base Database Service. This is required if using the `computeCount` parameter. If using `cpuCoreCount` then it is an error to specify `computeModel` to a non-null value. The ECPU compute model is the recommended model, and the OCPU compute model is legacy.

* `data_storage_size_in_gbs` - The data storage size, in gigabytes, that is currently available to the Database system. Applies only for virtual machine Database systems.

* `database_edition` - The Oracle Database Edition that applies to all the databases on the Database system. Exadata Database systems and 2-node RAC Database systems require EnterpriseEditionExtremePerformance.

* `database_system_options` - A `database_system_options` block as defined below.

* `database_version` - A valid Oracle Database version. For a list of supported versions, use the ListDbVersions operation.

* `disk_redundancy` - The type of redundancy configured for the Database system. NORMAL is 2-way redundancy. HIGH is 3-way redundancy.

* `display_name` - The user-friendly name for the Database system. The name does not have to be unique.

* `domain` - The domain name for the Database system.

* `grid_image_ocid` - The OCID of a grid infrastructure software image. This is a database software image of the type GRID_IMAGE.

* `hostname` - The hostname for the Database system.

* `license_model` - The Oracle license model that applies to all the databases on the Database system. The default is LicenseIncluded.

* `lifecycle_details` - Additional information about the current lifecycle state.

* `lifecycle_state` - The current state of the Database system.

* `listener_port` - The port number configured for the listener on the Database system.

* `location` - The Azure Region where the Database System exists.

* `memory_size_in_gbs` - Memory allocated to the Database system, in gigabytes.

* `network_anchor_id` - The ID of the Azure Network Anchor.

* `node_count` - The number of nodes in the Database system. For RAC Database systems, the value is greater than 1.

* `oci_url` - The URL of the resource in the OCI console.

* `ocid` - The [OCID](https://docs.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm) of the Database system.

* `resource_anchor_id` - The ID of the Azure Resource Anchor.

* `scan_dns_name` - The FQDN of the DNS record for the SCAN IP addresses that are associated with the Database system.

* `scan_ips` - The list of Single Client Access Name (SCAN) IP addresses associated with the Database system. SCAN IP addresses are typically used for load balancing and are not assigned to any interface. Oracle Clusterware directs the requests to the appropriate nodes in the cluster. Note: For a single-node Database system, this list is empty.

* `shape` - The shape of the Database system. The shape determines resources to allocate to the Database system. For virtual machine shapes, the number of CPU cores and memory. For bare metal and Exadata shapes, the number of CPU cores, storage, and memory.

* `source` - The source of the database for creating a new database.

* `ssh_public_keys` - A `ssh_public_keys` block as defined below. The public key portion of one or more key pairs used for SSH access to the Database system.

* `storage_volume_performance_mode` - The block storage volume performance level. Valid values are Balanced and HighPerformance. See [Block Volume Performance](/Content/Block/Concepts/blockvolumeperformance.htm) for more information.

* `time_zone` - The time zone of the Database system, e.g., UTC, to set the timeZone as UTC.

* `version` - The Oracle Database version of the Database system.

* `zones` - The Database System Azure zones.

---

A `database_system_options` block supports the following:

* `storage_management` - (Optional) The storage option used in Database system. ASM - Automatic storage management, LVM - Logical Volume management.


## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify [timeouts](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/configure#define-operation-timeouts) for certain actions:

* `read` - (Defaults to 5 minutes) Used when retrieving the Oracle.
