# Data Source: azurerm_oracle_exadata_infrastructure

Use this data source to access information about an existing Exadata Infrastructure.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_oracle_exadata_infrastructure" "example" {
  name                = "existing"
  resource_group_name = "existing"
}

output "id" {
  value = data.azurerm_oracle_exadata_infrastructure.example.id
}
```

A `estimated_patching_time` block exports the following:

* `estimated_db_server_patching_time` - The estimated time required in minutes for database server patching.

* `estimated_network_switches_patching_time` - The estimated time required in minutes for network switch patching.

A `maintenance_window` block exports the following:

* `days_of_week` - Days during the week when maintenance should be performed.

* `hours_of_day` - The window of hours during the day when maintenance should be performed. The window is a 4 hour slot. Valid values are: 0 - represents time slot 0:00 - 3:59 UTC - 4 - represents time slot 4:00 - 7:59 UTC - 8 - represents time slot 8:00 - 11:59 UTC - 12 - represents time slot 12:00 - 15:59 UTC - 16 - represents time slot 16:00 - 19:59 UTC - 20 - represents time slot 20:00 - 23:59 UTC

* `lead_time_in_weeks` -  Lead time window allows user to set a lead time to prepare for a down time. The lead time is in weeks and valid value is between 1 to 4.

* `months` - A `months` block as defined below.

* `patching_mode` -  Cloud Exadata infrastructure node patching method, either `ROLLING` or `NONROLLING`.
