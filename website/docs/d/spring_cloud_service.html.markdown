# Data Source: azurerm_spring_cloud_service

Use this data source to access information about an existing Spring Cloud Service.

!> Azure Spring Apps is now deprecated and will be retired on 2028-05-31 - as such the `azurerm_spring_cloud_service` data source is deprecated and will be removed in a future major version of the AzureRM Provider. See https://aka.ms/asaretirement for more information.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

data "azurerm_spring_cloud_service" "example" {
  name                = azurerm_spring_cloud_service.example.name
  resource_group_name = azurerm_spring_cloud_service.example.resource_group_name
}

output "spring_cloud_service_id" {
  value = data.azurerm_spring_cloud_service.example.id
}
```
