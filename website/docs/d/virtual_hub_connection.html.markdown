# Data Source: azurerm_virtual_hub_connection

Uses this data source to access information about an existing Virtual Hub Connection.

## Virtual Hub Connection Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_virtual_hub_connection" "example" {
  name                = "example-connection"
  resource_group_name = "example-resources"
  virtual_hub_name    = "example-hub-name"
}

output "virtual_hub_connection_id" {
  value = data.azurerm_virtual_hub_connection.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - The name of the Connection which should be retrieved.

* `resource_group_name` - The Name of the Resource Group where the Virtual Hub Connection exists.

*  `virtual_hub_name` - The name of the Virtual Hub where this Connection exists.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Virtual Hub Connection.

* `virtual_hub_id` - The ID of the Virtual Hub within which this connection is created

* `remote_virtual_network_id` - The ID of the Virtual Network which the Virtual Hub is connected

* `internet_security_enabled` - Whether Internet Security is enabled to secure internet traffic on this connection

* `routing` - A `routing` block as defined below.
