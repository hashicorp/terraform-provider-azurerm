# Data Source: azurerm_orchestrated_virtual_machine_scale_set

Use this data source to access information about an existing Orchestrated Virtual Machine Scale Set.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_orchestrated_virtual_machine_scale_set" "example" {
  name                = "existing"
  resource_group_name = "existing"
}

output "id" {
  value = data.azurerm_orchestrated_virtual_machine_scale_set.example.id
}
```

## Arguments Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) The name of this Orchestrated Virtual Machine Scale Set.

* `resource_group_name` - (Required) The name of the Resource Group where the Orchestrated Virtual Machine Scale Set exists.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:

* `id` - The ID of the Virtual Machine Scale Set.

* `location` - The Azure Region in which this Orchestrated Virtual Machine Scale Set exists.
