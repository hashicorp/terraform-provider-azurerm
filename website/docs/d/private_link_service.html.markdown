# Data Source: azurerm_private_link_service

Use this data source to access information about an existing Private Link Service.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "azurerm_private_link_service" "example" {
  name                = "myPrivateLinkService"
  resource_group_name = "PrivateLinkServiceRG"
}

output "private_link_service_id" {
  value = data.azurerm_private_link_service.example.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - The name of the private link service.

* `resource_group_name` - The name of the resource group in which the private link service resides.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The Azure resource ID of the Private Link Service.

* `load_balancer_frontend_ip_configuration_ids` - The list of Standard Load Balancer(SLB) resource IDs. The Private Link service is tied to the frontend IP address of a SLB. All traffic destined for the private link service will reach the frontend of the SLB. You can configure SLB rules to direct this traffic to appropriate backend pools where your applications are running.

* `location` - The supported Azure location where the resource exists.

* `nat_ip_configuration` - The `nat_ip_configuration` block as defined below.

* `tags` - A mapping of tags to assign to the resource.
