## Tool: `update-go-azure-sdk`

This tool updates the version of `hashicorp/go-azure-sdk` which is vendored in this repository, and then subsequently tries to update the Provider to account for any new API Versions.

Whilst this isn't going to be infallible, the intention is that when a new API Version is added to `hashicorp/go-azure-sdk` (via `hashicorp/pandora`) then the AzureRM Provider can be automatically updated to use that API Version - with any errors output for human review.

This tool makes a number of assumptions about the repository design, namely that an `internal` folder exists and that `hashicorp/go-azure-sdk` is not referenced outside of this directory - and in addition also tool assumes that Git is available and pre-configured.

Whilst this tool is intended to primarily be run in automation - [the `update-api-version` tool](../update-api-version) is better suited for interactive usage (since it won't perform rollbacks, and assumes the `hashicorp/go-azure-sdk` dependency is up-to-date).

### Example Usage

```bash
 $ go build . && ./update-go-azure-sdk --new-sdk-version=v0.20231005.1153009 --azurerm-repo-path=../../../                                                                                                      (tool/update-go-azure-sdk âš¡)
