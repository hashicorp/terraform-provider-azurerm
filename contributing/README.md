# AzureRM Provider Contributor Guides

**First,** thank you for your interest in contributing to the Azure Provider! And if you're unsure or anything, please do reach out for help. You can open a draft pull request (PR) or an issue with what you know or join the [Slack Workspace for Contributors](https://terraform-azure.slack.com) ([Request Invite](https://join.slack.com/t/terraform-azure/shared_invite/enQtNDMzNjQ5NzcxMDc3LWNiY2ZhNThhNDgzNmY0MTM0N2MwZjE4ZGU0MjcxYjUyMzRmN2E5NjZhZmQ0ZTA1OTExMGNjYzA4ZDkwZDYxNDE)) and we'll do our best to guide you in the right direction.

> **Note:** this documentation is a work-in-progress - if you see something that's not quite right or missing, we'd really appreciate a PR!

This contribution guide assumes you have at least a basic understanding of both Go and Terraform itself (for example you know what a Data Source and a Resource are) - more information on those can be found [in the Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/index.html).

The AzureRM Provider is a Plugin which is invoked by Terraform (Core) and comprised of Data Sources and Resources.

Within the AzureRM Provider, these Data Sources and Resources are grouped into Service Packages - which are logical groupings of Data Sources/Resources based on the Azure Service they're related to.

Each of these Data Sources and Resources has both Acceptance Tests and Documentation associated with each Data Source/Resource - the Acceptance Tests are also located within this Service Package, however the Documentation exists within a dedicated folder.

More granular documentation covers how these fit together - and the most common types of contribution we see:
