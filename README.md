General Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.12.x (to build the provider plugin)

Windows Specific Requirements
-----------------------------
- [Make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
- [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

For *GNU32 Make*, make sure its bin path is added to PATH environment variable.*

For *Git Bash for Windows*, at the step of "Adjusting your PATH environment", please choose "Use Git and optional Unix tools from Windows Command Prompt".*

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone git@github.com:terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-azurerm
$ make build
```

Using the provider
----------------------

```
# Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
provider "azurerm" {
  # More information on the authentication methods supported by
  # the AzureRM Provider can be found here:
  # http://terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html

  # subscription_id = "..."
  # client_id       = "..."
  # client_secret   = "..."
  # tenant_id       = "..."
}

# Create a resource group
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "production-resources"
  location = "West US"
}

# Create a virtual network in the production-resources resource group
resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "test" {
  name                = "production-network"
  resource_group_name = "${azurerm_resource_group.example.name}"
  location            = "${azurerm_resource_group.example.location}"
  address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
}
```

Further [usage documentation is available on the Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html).

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.12+ is **required**). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-azurerm
...
```

In order to run the unit tests for the provider, you can run:

```sh
$ make test
```

The majority of tests in the provider are Acceptance Tests - which provisions real resources in Azure. It's possible to run the entire acceptance test suite by running `make testacc` - however it's likely you'll want to run a subset, which you can do using a prefix, by running:

```
make testacc TESTARGS='-run=TestAccAzureRMResourceGroup'
```

The following Environment Variables must be set in your shell prior to running acceptance tests:

- `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
- `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `ARM_TENANT_ID`
- `ARM_ENVIRONMENT`
- `ARM_TEST_LOCATION`
- `ARM_TEST_LOCATION_ALT`
- `ARM_TEST_LOCATION_ALT2`

**Note:** Acceptance tests create real resources in Azure which often cost money to run.

Crosscompiling
--------------
```sh
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 make build
```
